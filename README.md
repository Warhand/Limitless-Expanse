### Playtesters Wanted!

If you play this modpack and want to let me know how you think, please head over to our [Issues page on GitHub](https://github.com/Warhand/Limitless-Expanse/issues) and open up a new **Player feedback** issue report. Any and all feedback you can provide will be valuable to making sure this project is as good as it can be!

**This pack is still in alpha, it may change, and certain features may be added or removed.**

Hello, and welcome to Limitless expanse! This is a little pet project of mine that I've been working on for a few months. With the goal being to create a modpack that offers an expanded experience on top of the base game, while not going completely to the level of kitchen sink.

---

**Here are a list of Limitless Expanses primary features**:

- A curated modlist that seek to expand upon vanilla mechanics, or add new mechanics that are complementary to vanilla.
- Hundreds of lines of custom scripting and datapacks, to further ensure compatibility and add new interactions and balance changes. This includes a few custom items with their own behaviors and recipes!
- Well optimized and lightweight, running on only **2 Gigabytes of allocated ram!**
- **THE SQUID**

---

**Here are a few features that are planned, but not yet fully implemented**:

- Custom quests, designed to serve as a loose tutorial, guiding players through the game while not railroading them.
- Multiplayer
  - Testing the stability of multiplayer as a whole, as well as the general balance of the game in that context.
  - Creating a dedicated server file, so people can run their own servers.
- Overall just adding more features and tweaking exisiting features to further fine-tune the game. This is especially true during this upcoming playtesting phase

Now, I'm partially of the opinion that part of the joy of this type of game is the exploration and figuring things out on your own. However if you would prefer to have a clearer idea of what is included in this pack from the get-go, here is a non-exhaustive list of changes and some of the larger included mods:

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

- Balanced hammers
- Vein mining enchantment
- Momentum enchant (Makes you mine faster the more you mine the same block in a row)
- Supplementaries
  - Removed the bombs (Using galosphere bombs instead)
  - Removed flax (Sack recipe uses farmer's delight canvas instead)
- Quark
  - Uses most things from oddities except matrix enchanting, totem of holding, and the backpack
  - Removed rope (Using rope from supplementaries instead, cause that includes more features, such as rope arrows)
- Illager invasion
- Custom sniffer loot (CT)
- Bundle recipe
- Hoes harvest farmers delight straw
- Galosphere (Adds new cave biomes and a new mineral, silver)
- Naturalist (New animals)
- Farmers delight
  - Renamed rope to twine to keep its unique functionality while also avoiding conflict with supplementaries rope
- Nerfed but still useful villagers (A mix of quark, a mod that makes villagers charge diamonds for diamond gear, and a mod that removes treasure enchants from librarians pools)
- Joy of painting (Lets players make custom paintings with a canvas)
- Stoneworks (Way more variety in blocks available for stone types, with a block variant for basically each type, including stuff like stone columns, granite tiles, and sandstone pavers)
- Enchanting infuser (Enchanting table with no randomization)
- Nether chest (Very expensive chest that stores items up to 512 per stack)
- Echo chest (Requires an echo shard, collects items and exp within range)
- Better anvils (Anvil repair costs are static and don't exponentially grow, making anvil repair viable)
- Hang glider (Early to mid-game gliding, without fireworks boosting)
- Ender zoology (Additional hostile mobs, mostly end themed)
- Geophilic (Vanilla biome enhancement)
- Better tridents (General QOL update for tridents)
- Nullscape & Amplified nether (Basically the same mod for both the nether and the end, increasing their worldgen height by a lot)
- Improved snow (Snow under trees and snow real magic)
- Tectonic (Honestly one of my favorite mods in the pack. Updates worldgen and makes it a lot more vertical, shifting between long flat plains and massive mountains, as well as big river caves.)
- Yungs suite (Basically a requirement for vanilla+)
- You've goat to be kidding me (Goat expansion, adds some more uses for goat horns, including a block breaker for pistons.)
- Various other bugfix and minor improvement mods
- A shitload of optimization mods (Embeddium, ferritecore, canary, etc...)
- Custom interactions with enderzoology ender charges, where they turn stone to end stone
- Added new mechanics for totems of undying, where they have a delay now on use, and are replaced by an inert form
- Added arrow bundles, which can be crafted with 8 arrows and twine. Stacks to 16, right click to release arrows. Can be used to craft infused arrows.

This pack is a labor of love, all about creating a gameplay experience that myself and others can enjoy. With that said, I hope that love comes through in the pack while you play it, and you're able to have as much fun with it as I have!
