PFD is based around the axiom that \"If you were to distill Minecraft to its essence, it would be the moment of gratification when a build is finished and you feel proud of yourself for having built it\".\n\nFor example, the image above shows off the Quark Oddities Copper Pipes. These pipes are purposely designed to work in an intuitive fashion, but still low to the ground in pathing and \"smart\" logic. This ensures that pipes are usable for large contraptions, while still being a challenge to do so, and providing that awesome moment when you finish your build.\n\nOddities is a \"pseudoaddon\", which means all the code for it is actually in Quark itself, and the Oddities jar serves only as a user friendly way to install the module and filter packs with it. You won't have to update the Oddities mod, as all the updates will be in Quark.\n\n---\n\n![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/support.png)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/patreon.png)](https://patreon.com/vazkii)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/store.png)](https://store.vazkii.net)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/ch.png)](https://violetmoon.org/creeperhost)","published":"2022-11-13T04:31:17.941550Z","updated":"2024-01-31T00:21:03.684864Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":40262,"followers":90,"categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.15.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["1hfd6PrK","9y3xOkZO","7feIisZX","gvWA7HWA","NrzERFzz"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qeEEslrN/d182256258d9d027a34072e3b7c7e3835f55437f.png"},"version":{"id":"NrzERFzz","project_id":"qeEEslrN","author_id":"kRXgk5E1","featured":false,"name":"1.20.1","version_number":"1.20.1","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-31T00:21:04.332540Z","downloads":10748,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d861797934748481931e00b9958500d83a9160fbe111b4bd4bd05777103daa48127906b21211436b5c2da2a9aef9d868459c5aebb5b1627b20c6f5d63dc54169","sha1":"69ed292c207af89febd156d83b3e78f64b35b969"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qeEEslrN/versions/NrzERFzz/QuarkOddities-1.20.1.jar","filename":"QuarkOddities-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":915,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"qnQsVE2z","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ii5t5Mod","user":{"id":"kRXgk5E1","username":"Vazkii","name":"Vasco Lavos","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794735?v=4","bio":"holy hell","created":"2022-11-13T03:09:41.900759Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"QuarkOddities-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\Bookshelf-Forge-1.20.1-20.1.10.jar":{"sha512":"29158563b4619ae97e876e132d4b5feb728df8b12af454aad3b0c4b996ffd113cf0995f720400d877df08d469466742c28ba27e6275abb889f1a2f121205bde0","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"uy4Cnpcm","slug":"bookshelf-lib","project_type":"mod","team":"qdYl5sw1","title":"Bookshelf","description":"An open source library for other mods!","body":"<p>Bookshelf is a collection of code, frameworks, utilities, and other resources.

It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel.

The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style.

This will explain the absence of updates. Why again? It's just not fun anymore and I am always worried about once again being embedded in annoying discord drama that somehow manages to suck every bit of enjoyment out of modding. There hasn't been anyone willing to step up and take over development and that's partly my fault. This notice is months late. If you enjoy fastload and intend to maintain it, just contact me on discord for a discussion. Please keep in mind that I won't respond quickly because I don't really use discord much at all anymore. Thank you for taking your time to read this!\n\n# Short explanation\nFastload is a *relatively* simple mod that changes some crucial parts of world loading to speed it up.\n\n# Environments\n- Client (Optional)\n- Server (Optional)\n\n# Credits\n- StockiesLad (Owner)\n- JoostMSoftware (Co-Owner)\n- AbdElAziz333 (Forge)\n- VidTu (Ksyxis (Idea))\n- kennytv (Forcecloseloadingscreen (Code))\n\n# Features\n- 441 Pre-generator: Entirely yanks it to sync chunk generation with chunk rendering.\n- Loading Screens: Cancellable (Configurable)\n- Rendering: Pre-rendering Phase (Configurable)\n\n# Suggested With\n- C2ME: Optimises chunk generation.\n- Sodium: Optimises chunk rendering.\n\n# Explanation\nThe 441 chunk loading engine is pretty much what the name is. The reason for it being 441 chunks is that\nit generates chunks in a 10 chunk radius as a square. So multiply that by 2, add 1 (because you are standing\non a chunk) and square it. Fastload removes this *feature* as it is a huge waste of time. Instead, it will\nonly load 1 chunk (the spawn chunk) and loads the rest of the spawn region during early rendering.\n\nAlong with that, it also replaces some of the loading screens with its own implementation. This pretty much\nallows rendering to begin immediately instead of it being halted until the player spawn packet is received.\n\n# Links\n- Modrinth: https://modrinth.com/mod/fastload\n- Curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastload\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/fMSnenNSXM\n\n","published":"2022-06-04T16:09:02.891982Z","updated":"2023-08-15T12:36:53.077035Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1302950,"followers":1259,"categories":["optimization","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","23w14a","23w16a","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["OAv8CrM0","hR5aj90D","Lbph3YVy","nkXCDjTX","CVP8s8T3","tFMofdbs","3j5R1tqr","opd0zx0e","iiKA1DWl","DVbkQeRT","bAEd4DsW","PjaIK1Vp","tAJHf9G7","wIStpaL0","8J8D4v6o","1wIMDix7","BnPn5A62","f4sYhmcE","meWCSzii","DJkYeZd5","1f1DA0KB","QNff3l3l","QlIwIIh9","C2LwOzJk","1uyZI4Sv","FKmzXNtY","K88McHch","DQlQxhhM","qIDVvUbg","nAfxWveV","MmygcB2M","zNe7bwry","Tv3wOvtj","ksl46t40","qkR1zzal","dKaZj3NX","bxgfNPxE","LtO049ip","RWontocM","tMBTPH4j","rGmamzE5","gdXi90uO","Dsgo7CSj","2Yda0wxa","pPHZxvSq","mBNst1pT","NHYFVTEV","WyunD6Js","N1SrNeBH","IpZXHH55","rxKwFSer","ZlGXwJvh","TQqs51tn","DadZpSjE","tMPV3Kkg","ZF0uERgW","FpDn2R2L","gIRDVsr1","a5IjqNvz","DlCLRU3a","WU1it2AO","FU50wLzH","DhZ4Ja4S","Y0vyVBp6","suyTpHDo","gO58JOqR","K9vr5fdy","OQyAqgWH","AWGFfzNY","Jy0nBwT7","n2GBDiY8","YvKzIdFE","lbg7lLOP","XzqjhWvy","GCH0zDV1","cOIVKLwU","FswsA1ru","pDTCLzgm","s3zsS0HW","tykaPrWr","ILYiaB6n","jbjSMJqM","JpRTQ4PR","vD6ndABa","WryJ0FUZ","FcFh2FAO","PB8AbQO3","BwDnLgzN","OxwM6hRt","u4FVRRGd","ys9T20o4","47qpvpOP","P17HkM27","9Kgnmrza","3cboK7gk","HDvAnQIw","Z8CqLDDO","nHeyxX0A","fbLmfqa5","ka9OYmub","5caSj7kt"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kCpssoSb/47742fe96d19cdad9a3eb6a73bd9c7c1547fb4ad.png"},"version":{"id":"5caSj7kt","project_id":"kCpssoSb","author_id":"3AXCrCqA","featured":false,"name":"Fastload 3.4.0 for MC 1.20.1","version_number":"mc1.20.1-3.4.0","changelog":"bump version.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-15T12:36:55.631401Z","downloads":175519,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"27d58f123951e0404c94caf16ff9b96b442f371c","sha512":"b8be6ed0bef707c7c34d84049eb68313a5c787f6e9c9a88fb94daed6bccfedc6c181a1fca431f53b6e8ac03c7baf7653414b5a5792cab6b500c6d66502489431"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kCpssoSb/versions/5caSj7kt/Fastload-Reforged-mc1.20.1-3.4.0.jar","filename":"Fastload-Reforged-mc1.20.1-3.4.0.jar","primary":true,"size":66989,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"3AXCrCqA","username":"AbdElAziz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89092953?v=4","bio":"I love all people","created":"2022-05-27T22:49:23.800376Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor","ordering":0},{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"GIn4UWLW","username":"KirboSoftware","name":"Joost","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80041873?v=4","bio":"I'm a junior software engineer who creates minecraft mods in my spare time and help with projects when I can","created":"2022-06-04T15:56:54.106893Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Co-owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"6RqzXTwc","username":"StockiesLad","name":"Fluffy Bumblebee","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60066663?v=4","bio":"A lad from stockies mate.","created":"2022-06-04T16:04:13.709905Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Fastload-Reforged-mc1.20.1-3.4.0.jar"},"mods\\cherishedworlds-forge-6.1.6+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"d34ad1e258f3f32d408436778d7ae0cc502f8310e3fd9336fda5894fd530164e9d15a01083e81feaaca0408533685d493fbf5bd765f66484fc04d295085d004a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"3azQ6p0W","slug":"cherished-worlds","project_type":"mod","team":"dzIBwCp9","title":"Cherished Worlds","description":"Favorite/pin/bookmark certain worlds, which will always be at the top of the list and cannot be deleted.","body":"Cherished Worlds is a mod that adds the ability to favorite/pin/bookmark certain worlds.\n\nWhen installed, empty star icons will appear next to every world on the select screen.

allows you to **specify a config once** and it then **handles reloading values between world loads, syncing values with clients**, and **generating values for client- or server-only** on its own.\n\n---\n\n### Creating a config:\nA config is created using a `ModConfigBuilder`.\nSimply create a new instance using `#ModConfigBuilder()`.\n```java\n   ModConfigBuilder builder = new ModConfigBuilder();\n```\nA value can be added to the config with `ModConfigBuilder#define` which takes a name and a default value.\nFor integer and double values a minimum and maximum value are also required.\n`ModConfigBuilder#define` returns a `Supplier` which should be stored to retrieve the value from the config.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> booleanValue = builder.define( \"booleanValue\", true );\n\n   Supplier<Integer> integerValue = builder.define( \"integerValue\", 5, 0, 10 );\n\n   Supplier<Double> doubleValue = builder.define( \"doubleValue\", 0.5, 0, 1);\n\n   Supplier<ExampleEnum> enumValue = builder.define( \"enumValue\", ExampleEnum.VALUE_1 );\n```\nA comment can be added to a value by calling `ModConfigBuilder#comment(String)` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> valueWithComment = builder.comment( \"this is a comment for 'valueWithComment'\" ).define( \"valueWithComment \", true );\n```\nBy default values are reloaded when world is loaded.\nThis can be changed to only reload a value when Minecraft launches by calling `ModConfigBuilder#gameRestart()` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notReloadedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be reloaded\" ).define( \"notReloadedValue\", true );\n```\nValues in COMMON or SERVER configs are synchronized with clients by default, to prevent this use `ModConfigBuilder#dontSync()`.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notSynchronizedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be synchronized\" ).define( \"notSynchronizedValue\", true );\n```\nValues can also be put into categories.\n`ModConfigBuilder#push(String)` pushes a category and `ModConfigBuilder#pop()` pops a category.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"special\" );\n   \n   Supplier<Boolean> specialValue = builder.comment( \"this value is in the 'special' category\" ).define( \"specialValue\", true );\n   \n   builder.pop();\n```\nA comment can be added to the active category using `ModConfigBuilder#categoryComment(String)`.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"client\" ).categoryComment( \"this, is a comment for the 'client' category\" );\n```\nAfter defining all values `ModConfigBuilder#build()` must be called to finish the config.\n```java\n   builder.build();\n```\nNow the values in your config will reloaded and synced automatically and the values can be retrieved using the stored `Supplier` instances.\nThis will work for all available versions, that includes Minecraft 1.12, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19.\n\n---\n\n### Example Mod:\nFor a

(Structure Library)","description":"Formations adds utilities for structure datapacks!","body":"![Formations banner](https://imgur.com/7ZCeoAT.png)\n\n<br>\n<center>\n\n### **Formations** is a library mod which adds additional features to datapacks for generating structures!\n</center>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/V9cw31J.png)\n\n## Features\n\n### Structure Types\nFormations adds two new structure types: `formations:simple` and `formations:pieced`. These essentially correspond to the vanilla regular and jigsaw structure types, but with better placement and a clearer json format.\nBoth types can choose from the following placements:\n| Identifier | Description |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| `surface` | Will place the structure at the top layer of solid blocks |\n| `ceiling` | Will place the at the bottom layer of solid blocks |\n| `on_water` | Will place the structure at the top layer of blocks if those blocks are water |\n| `on_lava` | Will place the structure at the top layer of blocks if those blocks are lava |\n| `underground` | Will place the structure somewhere between the top and bottom layers of blocks |\n| `underground_surface` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, at the bottom of an open area |\n| `underground_ceiling` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, at the top of an open area |\n| `underground_buried` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, such that it is not exposed to any open area |\n| `underground_on_lava` | Will place the structure between the top and bottom layers of blocks, in an open area on top of lava |\n\n### Structure Pool Element Types\nFormations adds one new structure pool element type, `formations:single_pool_element`. The element type allows setting a different ground level rather than vanilla's fixed ground level of 0. The ground level can be set through the `ground_level` key.\n\n### Structure Processors\nFormations adds a bunch of new structure processors.\n| Identifier | Parameters | Description |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| `formations:random_bed_color` | - | Randomizes the color of any beds |\n| `formations:biome_replacements` | - | Replaces certain blocks, such as wood, bricks and grass, based on the biome |\n| `formations:fill_brewing_stands` | `slotFillChance`, `maxBlazePowder` | Fills brewing stands with random potions and blaze powder ` |\n| `formations:fill_chiseled_bookshelves` | `slotFillChance` | Fills chiseled bookshelves with enchanted books |\n| `formations:block_age` | `mossiness`, `degradation`, `disintegration` | Randomly replaces regular blocks with mossy or cracked variants, full blocks with slabs or stairs, random blocks with air |\n| `formations:random_plant_growth` | `minGrowth`, `maxGrowth` | Randomizes the growth stage of any crops |\n| `formations:respawn_anchor_charges` | `minCharges`, `maxCharges` | Randomizes the number of charges of any respawn anchors |\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/LqyZP68.png)\n\n## Examples\nFor examples usage of the features, you can check out [<img width='25' alt='formations overworld logo' src='https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KX1XC0Oo/623ec34d4dbc1ca9c5aa6477f9043e86bbaa899b.webp'> Formations Overworld](https://modrinth.com/mod/formations-overworld) and [<img width='25' alt='formations nether logo' src='https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cGvQGRls/2e21f4c247ad58965c320f037c4febfa9cf827bb.webp'> \n Formations Nether](https://modrinth.com/mod/formations-nether)\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/V9cw31J.png)\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Can I use your mod in my modpack?**  \nYes, feel free to use my mod in your modpack\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/boQSGyP.png)\n\n## Discord\nFor future content, upcoming mods, and discussion, feel free to join the SuperMartijn642 discord server!

Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily. Fluids are virtual so they can only exist in modded container specifically for them\n \n\n-Dispenser utilities:\nSome code that allows to easily register dispenser behaviors without overriding already existing ones. Also comes with builtin spawn egg and block placement behaviors\n\n ","published":"2022-06-21T07:56:14.814685Z","updated":"2024-05-05T17:16:22.061536Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1309974,"followers":452,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["2vA7za0R","HnzRVHve","VFJlAomw","TdrX8qHu","ND0jV6Ba","wMvYwhzf","YZ1c6V1Y","7KfOaFNC","n36VFZgj","hjpH6YTS","TZqLAjc4","SNOfTsuq","BpwfruOR","ARzMom8z","bSd7CaVX","bYgSpZNX","sFlS58kl","MunWW5CV","ip1Rzqeo","VYcJMwhh","77PCqM0x","EWKHMqhL","48KdkfGF","LHQnKJPr","SUVVyNOn","iUir8IFb","CAaiQgHc","mMuXnmER","5CAvXUDI","Y9Yo8h10","Cwn2eAQI","1ZP9jeJp","JwDuktzc","aNax4jyH","RIqvRzdD","ANPz3UX0","wkQInAdt","5vaqrscY","rvr9aKfC","mzGChtna","dVl8oHMC","qfTdrUeL","KbGlKdHo","S3OlMtz3","zGJuxvK4","MwH6iRuX","GSlj8ip7","4x52sEBq","ZZzULVfd","sS7WRpan","hbIxgIk3","gO19W71w","4jTOJ2ZI","oZ6GRhj8","VhZo5bM4","TQkusKt9","368y55MX","8ZMdWvwz","r4wBdvIX","f5gtva35","8hghdRdh","GxCfXdHN","jwSm2KiR","F0NN8t9F","h4yyiupT","hzwrgZl8","gA9vpijP","KdTmjJVb","HjrG1F0r","fwqQVTzC","3WC47wPk","XMHhMXZd","G82otMKn","bjFaEsLT","Pi6AVDbd","1R2xmUor","Ti5Z22lJ","IVC9YnMt","gmoV0tyd","2PY4BLur","zLddLJPF","5ZwEaffq","ZTvfXhRv","NF5WIl7b","yOVUWvRf","5KCmgfbm","9OTYJk7a","v3BxhM1S","BHmy40Mt","AWhKa778","uiUPREjo","VoARfnSD","Xxa877fY","u857rKSQ","rznUqNwu","cmz3IAL2","gdtVX62P","7wxkhoX2","sMEl6tss","2Uz8dh1y","OuwCxc61","5N5K36U1","jEMUwADf","xAJqgTD0","96TZidKH","FWVFXkyg","7JKL4wL5","ihYnBDx3","ROwff1j7","yrhbhfSn","ZHuO4LiU","pFeITkZi","y04tJAwP","YkBLE8Oq","LTmKAyph","UxWlwJoD","kyMgJhmx","pKTlrvKt","Ovxp7vPe","NtrvPW5Z","Z6GA4zUd","kP7srLfi","Xv8cPrF8","ebGaMVM5","KlX1F156","SV4rUTK3","9OGPgOeF","M1JtNLFm","50P4wZoB","kDFjJOMB","lIrlI8Zz","JXolKGKT","GTSq9qXH","ZVLcOJJE","BdAPfRTo","XWjG3vWP","hZxT2b1p","uBnHFMR2","I1r3C7CG","sE2tTJLZ","gUtSDU9U","Gp0CQft9","MG6apqgk","J5E9L4AG","8j22jNcF","tAcvUB1b","X46edIfU","OKx9Elr9","uOIpFARl","LkOHvzOj","FmgUqwxg","FLKgQQZH","sgNQlLLv","Bwn3tASZ","1tR7YwgX","n665AUFc","JBBeBPK6","S9PrveOz","sNFzpvYl","WXwbgZvj","IeVioShx","mvCZhlZo","o7oqq3Lh","vjQmGhyI","9dcfZ4i9","mCdzmJZC","hj1UnmZ2","idIlWA9u","PXyqXIbn","fQhx5ml2","fia9z4h4","cKg5hnPJ","mHeZr8dp","IPLC6g62","3NoxJuBX","pglf5GDl","SrPhRlSQ","vnTrMyMb","vehbL6pP","9Cgq74lp","EYDLWwqS","Hl9ja4Gl","Z8apZ6lb","UrzlfaAz","4fEnQ2ua","JoEQ35TB","XlRP5PMn","7cwLznr1","C86Th6Cw","N1eo0JjB","TkEXwUpi","R3HUuRlb","yvWnUxeS","gK3ltYEo","9eKKGLgl","81iXq8Ua","ifaZqqbi","wAEWAPPs","X0mWyHDn","3z15qPRG","yKc5hWwB","613mgPdm","6WCyArcu","FreWFSqP","QzsElbGY","g0I9zd9f","QYOUgJFZ","g5fu5BKB","jx8jTIax","7FTjFbHI","6UdNaxrX","QEr4oCmZ","whxnG6tI","lsj3hYsg","v8shmez8","dE1OqDFw","buvzG5Eh","LOutWSjK","Ta3wPFEM","f6naP7j6","h6yrGow9","nkCKWwmU","QYPLYuej","Eax5TmfX","NkDayjzv","BsdtnGcc","i8LcMgkg","GFChSR1Q","5Zza2cPD","mSQCkfvX","FaHHZhWB","CSWnYqKU","olYe4Pvg","8BzRkauW","hiH76w7r","XYaisWHj","9T5izdE9","s6wGYEq5","j6jDosOf","wFJ6kLiM","XtugKOOJ","uqfvv0ms","PM712gqw","2O4lu5JH","G4l3R3Pb","MXuvNr3i","KJQ6UUBP","cGKy75i2","7O9YniXA","WBx7Ddq6","LGgzYsHU","IUITd8aF","LhoPcVBA","dfWWDslj","5MTISIoq","vBIzpz3C","95iGLvuV","JmKTlMTk","RNUEccJ3","Sn17BhlX","jlMUHPST","4Pn6H6LU","YAbYzYmZ","Fc74Sq3o","xFsTt0Ku","8UWgitat","AgF88xAa","LAcFOrdR","3sq8rKNi","WXnNfkOQ","bRdRjsBw","2RKyBUJh","8BAEKNuN","cEVwMp3J","5NKdFoez","StBAz5jK","dRWTiq1o","dLc984Lh","OWzOhWa1","IVjsKfDz","cFgWr0uf","wnLFf0Nc","rCLaOh9e","zxsIL6hW","DKi9sJC8","7wOWxvtd","BMFYaPZ4","pg9Xxrcb","t5FnO6dP","zQA9lTQr","cv8vKRPe","TDf2CeG9","FubHdmUL","7NLlFrFF","8og81efu","NBLqXmpa","IZUE22nG","JQtrjbXM","Ss8gDP6F","Jv6lR8aV","Fi0TCD7O","6AG0cMX6","uMZCwusw","oi8DYts3","5QbwmlBE","n3GjNlx6","ycRzQlXJ","oTRatPAP","yquNskKL","CbCy1LiO","M8sd9nyu","e93w6V0s","hCmcGN2x","WtQPtpOg","OkmMqBP5","ypbJKwW0","wwZF0CTX","fNxFC0pt","PXdkmy2e","favv6G7H","jOzdT1LR","gnSKWxm4","ZgfYQJJR","7PV35Cya","s2SeQuIY","JDl2M220","LdkViV3L","kxERHwYJ","njpFMA6B","pk2qJx6m","UnP0v4AC","aeiy0BML","Go1eYHmQ","Cuzt6kYP","js8YrtNd","Asee8uGo","UYBCMpsC","iAUu6joU","xGNGCHkB","7r8TleZN","GaHAWKFN","aoXpagIV","5Ic61SOJ","Y2coeQBy","wldQnfTY","WRTGYYwK","rL76IQAG","kWp5Y5C9","FSr3bS7l","g1NYtQkD","sBdauEYc","jwHI7W1V","Hrg4AXGA","cP4hkgv1","CUoXbepB","zRXo9SbS","zYK4kSID","7X9Ap8XG","OS1Spie4","nOP9IgtT","qZEcqr3j","H78hNSMP","u5W05Nll","uKalHaQF","DCYqLiyn","yui9wjUi","vivHKObd","2RDhJhN7","unsnRxp1","elfXvPlb","QplPUcMZ","o50IGtrs","SBI44BXf","CV8lDNyD","2O5fg0oB","JEGquuvM","kxiwYQnp","tAnlg8ff","tNmV8F3e","bIIUFcYw","WOsQY4RE","qDW4WXAw","p6nioh9J","XdWNv88P","DoxaOeBf","fLxJRzSX","cdNu7PK8","l53OchaO","ZloMzYX2","luqVInL6","c1lxzTbA","ZOqeyUiV","ej91c9V8","93Yehddj","7saLSGbf","OOWX2Oij"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/twkfQtEc/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"cdNu7PK8","project_id":"twkfQtEc","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"forge_1.20-2.11.12","version_number":"forge_1.20-2.11.12","changelog":"fixed

Less Leaves Reforged is a unoffical Forge port of Cull Less Leaves:**(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cull-less-leaves).\n\nThis mod gives you a **9% fps improvement for rendering leaves.**\n\n**Join my discord for support, suggestions and discussion with others**\n\n######

the last two major release versions of Minecraft for all of my mods (that's currently 1.18.2 and 1.19.2).\n\n#### 📢 **Looking for more performance mods? Try:**\n\n*   [Immediately Reforged Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast-reforged)\n*   [Cull Less Leaves Reforged](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/culllessleaves-reforged)\n*   [Enhanced Block Entities Reforged](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enhanced-block-entities-reforged-unofficial)\n*   [Dimensional Threading Reforged](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dimensional-threading-reforged)\n\n### **Important Notes and Requests**\n\nThe original copyright owner **isXanderIsDev** who created the Fabric version of Cull (Less) Leaves.\n\nBig shoutout to [gaxyll](https://www.curseforge.com/members/gaxyll/projects) for creating the logo for me - tysm.\n\nPlease do not report issues with this port to the original owner or to their GitHub repo. Please report it to [mine](https://github.com/CCr4ft3r/CullLessLeavesReforged/issues).  \nPlease do not join their discord or post a comment on their mod page in order to get support for my port. Please post your questions here.\n\nThis port currently does not change any of the original optimizations. On code side the only differences are the following ones:\n\n*   I adapted the class references and mixin injection points to match it to SRG and Forge\n*   I removed one of the original embedded libraries by using the default mixin annotation classes\n*   I removed some compatibility modes for one mod that does not exist for Forge.\n\nThis port is fully compatible with Rubidium/Embeddium* and Oculus. It also should work with Optifine however it will be not officially supported by me.\n\n### **How it works**\n\nInstead of leaving just the outer layer of leaves, Cull Less Leaves also renders a certain amount of layers defined in the config.\n\n* Rubidium for 1.18.2-1.19.2\n* Embeddium starting from 1.20\n\n![comparison](https://i.imgur.com/gicGSgK.png)\n\nRubidium/Embeddium

In simpler terms, it's a large mod with lots of small features, aimed at improving the vanilla game. \nEvery feature can be turned on and off individually at your will, and most features contain further options to tweak the game just how you like it.\n\nWith quark installed, the title screen will get a new \"q\" button added to it. This button allows you to configure quark from inside the game, so you can easily turn off any features you don't vibe with.\n\n---\n\n# Features\n\nQuark has over a hundred different modules to play with, but here's a small highlight reel of our favorites:\n\n* Feeding Trough, for automatic animal breeding\n* Pistons Push Tile Entities, just like in Bedrock Edition\n* Japanese and Industrial style building blocks\n* Variant versions for Bookshelves, Chests, and Ladders for all wood types\n* Vertical Slabs, for all slabs already in the base game and Quark\n* Advanced Camera Mode for fancy screenshots\n* Toretoises, typo intended - new underground animals that grow ore on their back\n* Pickarang, a pickaxe that can be thrown as a boomerang\n* Trowel, a new tool to place random blocks from your hotbar, for paths or ruins\n* Emote system, allowing your character to do all sorts of motions from the chat menu\n* Reacharound Placing, which lets you place blocks under other blocks without being able to see the bottom face\n* Azalea Wood, replacing the Oak wood in Azalea trees with a pleasant green\n* Glimmering Weald, a new rare deep underground biome with glowing mushrooms and a cute new stone fae mob\n\nAnd many, many more!\n\n---\n\n# Learn more about Quark today\n### Visit the **[Official Website](https://quarkmod.net/)**\n\n* Visit the [Old Website](https://quarkmod.net/old) (for Minecraft versions 1.12 and prior)\n* Check out [what changed](https://vazkii.notion.site/Quark-3-0-Forge-1-18-Release-Notes-f22ef705b677421585f1208156a82b44) between Quark for 1.16 and Quark for 1.18\n* Download [Quark Oddities](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark-oddities), an addon focusing on more complex and technical features\n\n---\n\n# Compatibility\n\nQuark has built-in compatibility for a few mods, including JEI and TerraBlender.\n\nQuark may be incompatible with Optifine. If you are having issues using the two together, please uninstall Optifine and use a Sodium fork instead. \n\nAdditionally, if you are experiencing load crashes on 1.20.1, make sure your other mods are up to date, as any mods with integration from older versions will not function until updated.\n\n---\n\n![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/support.png)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/patreon.png)](https://patreon.com/vazkii)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/store.png)](https://store.vazkii.net)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/ch.png)](https://violetmoon.org/creeperhost)","published":"2022-11-13T03:56:40.716482Z","updated":"2024-04-15T06:00:44.281099Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":385055,"followers":485,"categories":["game-mechanics","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.9.4","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["hUHoJ8IU","DWIopZ9p","z07wlDPM","MPJKDJmI","etJaVjwR","LQATRjJy","WVcMK697","e4xifKGM","NBd2DS3z","aLMcsDgH","KnCaeyy6","dNfuCJua","LrasAC1d","kDj0Fa7f","ywSMRT9e","kYMyxgpY","JThLxL7g","L9PRqT3G","Y5dUVG07","jchiLv3T","J2ikYge8","hxZ3rlaJ","4JhlPAZH","kGwG7wZ9","XV6IcdSU","ieBJd6v7","lYGV9kJO","NRZpkg7a","c7hTFL3Q","Nhn8Fatv","9ihQgCxD","qNOl7hL2","JXifdD4Q","SabfrHOJ","Vjf1btuB","8B3wEsDO","zyvZoGBo","l56EicrO","QipVljYx","htdpIhCQ","stYFI7Km","Bz5rycUV","2y7uLplb","nYJW7kfd","mxjAPHWr","ZqUi5HxP","M1mbFwiX","8po5DGR8","aKj03FLO","1d9CRYwK","sLfwgQ44","233kpcpB","a8AI08wJ","2u6IMNar","oTVxvQ9o","4vXzGj8g","85thgL6V"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qnQsVE2z/64151f8964bc6b81d968e814bf7344bbdfad27d0.png"},"version":{"id":"85thgL6V","project_id":"qnQsVE2z","author_id":"kRXgk5E1","featured":false,"name":"1.20.1-4.0-441","version_number":"1.20.1-4.0-441","changelog":"https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Quark/releases/tag/release-1.20.1-4.0-441","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-15T06:00:45.868541Z","downloads":13248,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"4cb23c24b56fafce47efa36c75a3a4ca1ebd17d16c37b72a5f8cd2d73998c61dc5e613acb03c89183529b92ff06a4bfb2e9a9a495247123be43165a2f3f403e7","sha1":"8d77be1895584535700397f4c909ec3959941f67"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qnQsVE2z/versions/85thgL6V/Quark-4.0-441.jar","filename":"Quark-4.0-441.jar","primary":true,"size":14733403,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"MVARlG2f","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"kRXgk5E1","username":"Vazkii","name":"Vasco

own and its only purpose is to act as a dependency for other mods that use its features.\n\n## About\n\nMelody is an OpenAL-based client-side library mod for playing background music.<br>\nIt allows you to use OpenAL in Minecraft separated from Minecraft's sound engine and manager.\n\nMelody allows you to (asynchronously) load audio files from all kinds of sources, including web sources.\n\nIt has built-in support for OGG and WAV audio files, but there's nothing stopping you from extending it to support more file types!\n\nTo get an idea of how to create ready-to-play audio sources, take a look at Melody's [`SimpleAudioFactory`](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Melody/blob/1.20.1/common/src/main/java/de/keksuccino/melody/resources/audio/SimpleAudioFactory.java) class!\n\nEverything important is documented in the source, so make sure to take a look at [Melody's source on GitHub](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Melody)!\n\n## Copyright & Licensing\n\nMelody Copyright © 2023 Keksuccino.<br>\nMelody is licensed under MIT.\n\n## Server Needed?\n\nYou need a Minecraft server to play with your friends but it's just too much work to setup one on your own?<br>\nNo problem, just rent an ready-to-use server and start playing in a snap!\n\nJust click on the image below and use the code **keksuccino** to get **25% off** your first month!\n\n<a

to ease developing multiplatform mods.\n\n### What is Architectury API\n\nArchitectury API is an api to abstract calls to fabric api and forge api as both loader has different implementations of\nwhat can be perceived as the same thing.\n\nArchitectury API updates regularly, with new hooks and features. Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature — Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version! Note that this is for 1.19.2+ only.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/omRqM-gZBAg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\"

Block, Geep, Barbaric Helmet and Chevon meat:\n\n<center>\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/L7dBwZPX/images/42b47334aacbd2bee1fa77ec08b209ee00dae7ab.png)\n## 🐐 Features 🐐\n</center>\n\n### Ram Block\n\nThe Ram Block is a block-breaking oriented block crafted from goat horns. With the help of a piston, the Ram block can damage and break blocks, much like a goat ramming into a tree.\n\nBreak speed depends on the hardness of the block. Additionally it will be able to break anything up to obsidian hardness but only iron tier blocks will drop\n\nDoes not work with enchantments as it's a block\n\nAlso inflicts knockback and damage on entities when pushed\n\n### Barbaric Helmet\n\nThe Berserker Helmet is a life-saving piece of equipment crafted from goat horns and copper. It provides the player with strength and speed on lower health.\n\n### Chevon\n\nChevon is a new meat dropped from goats.\n\n### The Geep\n\nGeeps are the result of breeding a goat with a sheep. they cannot breed themselves, but does yield wool and chevon, and can be milked.\n\nAlso they are more frail with less health and cannot be dyed\n\n### Thatch\n\nDecorative building block perfect for your nordic builds!\n\n<center>\n\n## ⚙️ Mod Integration ⚙️\n</center>\n\n> If Windswept is installed, Chevon meat will be disabled in favor of its ones\n> Chevon can be used in some Farmers Delight recipes\n\n*Make sure you have enough ram!*\n\n*Credits to Ariboa12 for the barbaric helmet idea*\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

aiming to completely reimagine modded Minecraft while upholding these same unique, vanilla-style design principles. I highly recommend you [check it out!](https://modrinth.com/modpack/legacies)_\n\nReimagined Trims overhauls the armor trim system introduced in 1.20 by adding a well-thought, unique and balanced duplication recipe to each and every smithing template recipe, to better showcase each trim's specific achievement and make armor trims viable early-game. The netherite upgrade duplication recipe remains unchanged.\n\nIf you'd rather not explore and find the templates to discover the recipes yourself, the duplication recipes can be found in the [Image Gallery](https://modrinth.com/datapack/revamped-trims/gallery), alongside information on where to find each armor trim.\n\n### Host your own Server\n\nIf you're interested in playing Minecraft (with or without my mods) with your friends, I recommend you **[take a look at Kinetic Hosting!](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=55)**. For 5GB ram, they charge under $13USD a month for Performance, and under $6 for Budget, not including my discount code! I personally use their performance servers, and their specs, price, support and easy-to-use panel are the best of all the hosts I've been with. In addition, you can **[use code LEGACY for 15% off](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=55)** your first month!\n\n<details>\n<summary>More Info</summary>\n\nYes, I am partnered with them (and a member of their feedback team), but as an already-existing customer of them (and have paid and still pay for their servers myself), I can legitimately say they're great, regardless of whether I'm partnered with them. They're just genuinely good, I know the support team, they're super friendly and quick. The server specs are as good as you can get, and importantly, they aren't overpriced, unlike other hosts - in fact, they're less than half the price of quite a few big competitors I've seen around here, with no downside! If you need a server, these guys truly know what you're doing, and will respect your wallet when they do it.

The viewer can also apply deobfuscation mappings.\n\nIt works by sampling statistical data about the systems activity, and constructing a call graph based on this data. The call graph is then displayed in an online viewer for further analysis by the user.\n\nThere are two different profiler engines:\n* Native `AsyncGetCallTrace` + `perf_events` - uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) (*only available on Linux x86_64 systems*)\n* Built-in Java `ThreadMXBean` - an improved version of the popular [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) by sk89q.\n\n### ⚡ Memory Inspection\n\nspark includes a number of tools which are useful for diagnosing memory issues with a server.\n\n* **Heap Summary** - take & analyse a basic snapshot of the servers memory\n  * A simple view of the JVM's heap, see memory usage and instance counts for each class\n  * Not intended to be a full replacement of proper memory analysis tools. (see below)\n* **Heap Dump** - take a full (HPROF) snapshot of the servers memory\n  * Dumps (& optionally compresses) a full snapshot of JVM's heap.\n  * This snapshot can then be inspected using conventional analysis tools.\n* **GC Monitoring** - monitor garbage collection activity on the server\n  * Allows the user to relate GC activity to game server hangs, and easily see how long they are taking & how much memory is being free'd.\n  * Observe frequency/duration of young/old generation garbage collections to inform which GC tuning flags to use\n\n### ⚡ Server Health Reporting\n\nspark can report a number of metrics summarising the servers overall health.\n\nThese metrics include:\n\n* **TPS** - ticks per second, to a more accurate degree indicated by the /tps command\n* **Tick Durations** - how long each tick is taking (min, max and average)\n* **CPU Usage** - how much of the CPU is being used by the server process, and by the overall system\n* **Memory Usage** - how much memory is being used by the process\n* **Disk Usage** - how much disk space is free/being used by the system\n\nAs well as providing tick rate averages, spark can also **monitor individual ticks** - sending a report whenever a single tick's duration exceeds a certain threshold. This can be used to identify trends and the nature of performance issues, relative to other system or game events.\n\n## Usage\nTo install, just add the **.jar** file to your mods directory.\n\nInformation about [how to use commands](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/Command-Usage) can be found in the docs.\n\nIf you’d like help analysing a profiling report, or just want to chat, feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PAGT2fu).\n\n\n## Guides\nThere are a few small \"guides\" available in the docs, covering the following topics.\n* [The tick loop](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/The-tick-loop)\n* [Finding the cause of lag spikes](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/Finding-lag-spikes)","published":"2021-06-04T13:36:54.735179Z","updated":"2024-05-06T17:10:49.440737Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":983465,"followers":818,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["JdNt7oGW","liwd7pvc","D6L5yWtJ","huGeKmwp","sf2nOVoP","DhT8Y7bB","b3zKGLTS","yysWZODg","eEAJpQea","VkKsarbC","qBdtA5uj","6BEDTXhR","9NSIbttL","JjikdHMk","sYlxF6IX","CWiQ0oM4","xvqXC3WU","X9SnVAPS","jg0K11We","Biivc7P1","g60nhl1v","LVujS26K","6hatB19T","FnKxsd40","mMSAkTm6","3opVno4q","EWTsXhFU","RhyaY2vw","XXMFHMBO","OT1CD9Qj","E5XaSI1N","1K3xO8TS","23U6xkbl","g5rM8xSA","pjW9S4dI","N7JzEApO","1dlOe6ez","XhFbpH8f","VhY9p1RU","GygIHGfW","qyMNf4Pn","oCK984FP","dVHkMOHv","Yp6s4wsw","BeIg1bik","4FXHDE9F","XGW2fviP","h0Z2ObM0","tCU9VuzX","8ZQqfeXy","3FEq2lT7","FeV5OquF","iKVUNCME","i3FZxFQO","h0hKeaRD","85t1ZpLC","vl2NraaO"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/l6YH9Als/13676ddae142a85998c1c0086cafc30ce2efde80.png"},"version":{"id":"4FXHDE9F","project_id":"l6YH9Als","author_id":"iRtG8gdL","featured":false,"name":"1.10.53 (Forge 1.20.1)","version_number":"1.10.53-forge","changelog":"This update brings the latest version of spark for Minecraft 1.20.1 to Modrinth.

I couldn’t think of a name and called it the first name that came to my head as a placeholder “Sully”, the name stuck and now people think my name is actually Sully. <br/> \nBack then it was made with MCreator and combined with the fact that I back then didn’t have a good understanding of vanilla feel, it became more limited each version. I decided to completely revamp the mod, completely dumping the MCreator version and getting a coding team (Uraneptus and MiteBeMana). <br/>\nWith each feature I try to think it out as well as I can, making sure the feature is well-balanced, feels fun to play with and overall just feels like something new. It tries it’s best to feel like a Minecraft update full of random features.

YUNG's Better Desert Temples redesigns vanilla desert temples to be way more exciting, adding a variety of new puzzles, traps, &amp; parkour challenges. And of course, you'll get much better loot than vanilla's desert temples for your troubles!\n</p>\n<p>\nBy default, mining fatigue will be applied to all players in the Better Desert Temple. Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config. Additionally, you can re-enable vanilla desert temples to spawn alongside Better Desert Temples in the config.\n</p>\n<p>\nCloser look: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TpkTeTeDKJo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnimated trailer: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1C5Z0DaOQk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JR6R3uf.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Desert Temples is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Mineshafts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-mineshafts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Mineshafts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Strongholds\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-strongholds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Strongholds</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Dungeons\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Dungeons</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Bridges\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-bridges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Bridges</a></li>\n<li>Repurposed Structures.

They're not meant to be just some houses or dungeons, but new things that feel new and interesting while not being too out of place. The main goal is to make exploration more interesting, rewarding, but also just to enrich the stale Minecraft world.  \n\nStructures are also made to be well adapted to surrounding terrain, to not create superflat-like terrain or ugly cliffs in your world. And on top of that, they're properly integrated and should be compatible with all kinds of mods!  \n\nThis is a data pack packaged as a mod, meaning it is fully server-side. You can install it on vanilla servers and have vanilla clients join.  \n\nI hope you like it! More structures will get added over time.  \n\n### 📦 Content\nFor a list of structures with descriptions see the gallery!  \n\n### 📝 Notes\nPlease also know that this mod is still in development and new versions may differ significantly. I might make any changes, including the removal of structures. While Minecraft can handle this and updating the mod will not corrupt your world, it's still best to make backups.  \n\n### ⚙ Configuration\nIf you want to adjust the frequency of structures to your liking, you can use a custom data pack. A template is [available here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/explorify/download/4111372) (for versions v1.19-1.2.x). If you want a structure to not generate at all, remove it from the \"structures\" list inside the relevant file.

A. Q. ❓</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

Or if you prefer a more direct guide, [click here!](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight is currently being updated for 1.18.2 and 1.19+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No, this mod will never be backported to older versions. The game's older codebases are entirely different, and usually missing important features this mod depends on.\n**Please do NOT ask for backports!**\n\n**Q. Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?**\n\nA. Not currently, but thanks for your consideration! I'm currently well-sustaned by a stable job, and my personal projects are hobbies I work on my free time. My suggestion is to donate your money to more worthy causes, or just treat yourself to a nice lunch. ;)","published":"2022-08-07T23:18:53.898484Z","updated":"2024-01-22T02:29:38.409339Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":543889,"followers":733,"categories":["decoration","equipment","food"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["kwef5VB1","jc4l8jNt","jhP9p06T","huqohPcW","yE9Uj2ud","vKnBI3zc","uRQmgrHj","N1aLfuNT","p5bkNiw0","9N99D1CJ","tKCwnbTN","umpztmTl","k7RoRFPF","rFTKVUtq","AxgOboGq"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/R2OftAxM/8e7aa38ab94d94bb0a2894a218b69beb49002b34.png"},"version":{"id":"AxgOboGq","project_id":"R2OftAxM","author_id":"btHGOarG","featured":true,"name":"Farmer's Delight 1.2.4 - 1.20.1","version_number":"1.20.1-1.2.4","changelog":"## 1.2.4\n\n### Updates\n- The Cooking Pot item now displays more information than before:\n  - A blue bar will be shown to indicate the amount of meal servings stored, similar to how Bundles display their fullness;\n  - The tooltip will display the stored food's item sprite alongside its name;\n- When viewing basic crops in JEI, they will display info on where they can be found as Wild Crops.\n\n### Fixes\n- (1.20) Creative Tab registration has been moved to server-side, so that other mods can access them for game logic;\n- Structure files for compost heaps are now format-updated with datagen, thus avoiding excessive DFU triggers on world gen.

Even after the enchanting screen is closed! To put this new capability to good use, enchanting tables will <strong>Render Their Contents</strong> in the world. There are two different rendering modes to choose from.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Rerolling Enchantments</strong> has become extremely easy. The enchanting screen now has a dedicated button to do just that at a small cost of some lapis lazuli and a few experience points (not full enchantment levels to not ruin your level progress for enchanting as much). Costs are fully configurable and can even be set to completely free.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Enchanting tooltips will show not just a single random enchantment, instead they show the <strong>Complete Outcome</strong> of the enchanting process. This feature is disabled by default.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Additionally, to enable some basic automation, <strong>Hoppers</strong> can be used to input and output items in the following ways.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Top:</strong> Input for enchantable items</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Sides:</strong> Input for lapis lazuli</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bottom:</strong> Output for enchanted items</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">And <strong>Comparators</strong> work, too! They will output a signal strength of 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the amount of lapis lazuli items placed in the table. More than 3 items don't make a difference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Bookshelves no longer require <strong>Air Blocks</strong> between themselves and the enchanting table to count towards the current enchanting power. Instead, any block without a collision box, such as water, torches, or grass can be placed in between.

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-magic-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I just installed Easy Magic and it's not working!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> No new capabilities will be added to existing enchanting tables. You will need to manually break and replace the block. Same goes for converting enchanting tables back to vanilla after removing the mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: The new button for rerolling enchantments added to the enchanting screen is incompatible with my resource pack!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> The client config has an option to keep the book from the vanilla screen, the rerolling button will simply not be visible then. Rerolling still works as before, just by clicking the book now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I want anvils to keep and render their contents as well!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure thing, check out my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-anvils\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Easy Anvils</span></a> mod which does just that and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I'm using Apotheosis' or Quark's enchanting system, will Easy Magic work as well?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sadly no, Easy Magic only supports the vanilla system and will be overridden by other mods introducing their own.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\"

logo](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/images/3797bb32f05af523d3ec2a76b6c3c4f9187fac50.png)\n\nWelcome to **Tectonic**, a world generation project that aims to transform how terrain is shaped.\n\n## Important Notes\n\nTectonic is available as a datapack and as a Fabric/Neoforge mod. Forge mod versions are discontinued starting with 1.20.5.\n\nIf you are using Terralith with Tectonic **as datapacks**, install [Terratonic](https://modrinth.com/datapack/terratonic) instead of Tectonic. If you are using the two projects **as mods**, you don't need to install anything extra.\n\n## Description\n\nTectonic makes several large, impactful changes to worldgen.\n\nFeatures labeled with 🎚️ can be toggled on and off in the mod version's config file.\n\n### Mountain Ranges\n\nThe way mountains generate has been completely overhauled, with them forming huge mountain ranges that can stretch for thousands of blocks. These can stretch higher than vanilla mountains do, sometimes reaching peaks above y300!\n\nThe mod version's config file provides several options for customizing mountain generation:\n- `terrain_scale`: Vertically scales terrain, higher values = more extreme terrain heights\n- `horizontal_mountain_scale`: Horizontally scales mountains, lower values = less steep mountain slopes\n- `increased_height`: Enables a built-in datapack that increases the Overworld build and generation height to 640\n\n### Underground Rivers 🎚️\n\nIn mountainous terrain that is too towering to allow regular river generation, terrain gets carved for rivers to continue underground. These link right up to the regular rivers, so there's no interruption in exploring along rivers.  Very deep underground, you can even find a deeper variant with lava instead of water.\n\n### Oceanside Cliffs\n\nOn some steep cliff faces in the Stony Shore biome, waves and wind carve into the cliff. (Disclaimer: waves and wind not included.)\n\n### Smoother Surfaces\n\nOne of (if not the most) notable changes to generation you'll see with Tectonic is that terrain is much smoother than normal.

Not only do items stay inside the interface after closing, also some annoying restrictions are removed. Also name tags can be renamed without even using an anvil.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">First of all, anvils now have an <strong>Inventory</strong> for storing the items you put inside. This also means items will stay in the anvil after you close the interface. To put this functionality to good use, anvil contents will now <strong>Render</strong> as laying on top of the anvil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils no longer use the prior work penalty tag, so no matter how often you repair an item or add new enchantments to it, <strong>Costs Won't Needlessly Increase</strong>. You can also fully <strong>Configure The Max Level Limit</strong>, which controls when the <i>Too Expensive!</i> flag shows up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils can now be <strong>Repaired</strong> by one stage using iron blocks. You can also use a dispenser to automate repairing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Name tags have quite a few nice changes: Not only is setting a name in an anvil <strong>Completely Free</strong> and doesn't risk damaging your precious anvil, you don't even need an anvil at all anymore to change a name tag's name. Simply shift + right-click a name tag to <strong>Open A Simple Interface</strong> for setting a new name.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Text Can Be Stylized</strong> using Minecraft's native formatting codes in both the anvil and name tag interface. This allows for setting custom colors and styles when choosing item and entity names. Check the <a href=\"https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes#Usage\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Minecraft Wiki</strong></span></a> for more information on formatting codes.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/27/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/28/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Anvils can be so fancy!</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Free name tag renames</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/29/2022-09-29_09.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/30/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>No max level limit anymore</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>No anvil required for renaming name tags anymore</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/422/2022-10-04_21.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/424/2022-10-04_21.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Repair anvils by one stage using iron blocks</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Use formatting codes when naming your equipment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I want enchanting tables to keep and render their contents as well!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure thing, check out my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-magic\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Easy Magic</span></a> mod which does just that and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Forge on versions of Minecraft before 1.17?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Check out the mods which inspired this project: <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-tweaks\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvil Tweaks</span></a>, <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-repair\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvil Repair</span></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nametags-without-anvils\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Nametags Without Anvils</span></a> by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/tfarecnim\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>tfarecnim</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for

I've bundled them in this mod.\n\nThis mod adds a bunch of optional tweaks to improve the Quality of Life during gameplay. Tweaks can be individually enabled or disabled and configured. Many of the tweaks are disabled by default, so make sure to enable the features you want for the most bestest experience possible.\n\n## Features\n\n### No Offhand Torch With Block\nThis option will refuse to place a torch if you're holding a block in your main hand. Because there's no way you intended to place a torch in that case. Something was just standing in the way of the spot you wanted to place that block in but the torch was fitting since it's smaller. Fixed it for ya.\n\n### No Offhand Torch With Empty Hand\nYou know that feeling when you're tired, try to open the chest but misclicked the block next to it? And of course you still had a torch in your offhand. And of course it placed it. And now you have to break it again. Ugh. This option only allows torches to be placed when your main hand is not empty. This can be enabled additionally to the above.\n\n### Offhand Torch With Tools Only\nThis is the option I consider best, but it changes vanilla behaviour too much to be the default. This will only allow placing torches from the offhand when you're holding a tool. No more accidental torch placement, ever again.\n\n### Do Not Use Last Torch\nThis option is useful when using dynamic lights such as OptiFine. The last torch in your offhand will not be placeable, so you always have a light to carry around with you secured.\n\n### Hide Own Effect Particles\nThis option will make your own potion effect particles a lot less obtrusive for your client. Other players will see them normally. No more annoying particles blocking your view.\n\n### Hide Offhand Item\nWill prevent the item in your offhand from rendering, in case you hate seeing the torch you're carrying on the left. This can be toggled by a keybind too, in case you only hate seeing your offhand item sometimes.\n\n### Hide Shield Unless Holding Weapon\nWill prevent shields from being rendered in your offhand unless you're holding a weapon. Specifically, it needs to be a sword or an axe with an attack damage value greater than 1.5 hearts. No, that wooden stick you're holding isn't a weapon.\n\n### Auto Climb Ladder\nI often make really long ladders down to my mine, and it's a pain having to hold down a key the whole time while climbing back up. With this tweak on, you will continue to climb upwards as long as you look upwards while on a ladder. That means you can type in chat and do other things without instantly falling back down and losing all of your progress on the long journey.\n\n### Disable Potion Shift\nPrevents the inventory from being shifted to the right when potion effects are active. You probably never noticed because NEI did it in 1.7.10 and now Quark does it in 1.10.2 and then there's also a mod called No Potion Shift that does it, but in case you have none of these, you now have this!\n\n### Toggle Off Step Assist\nThere's people who hate step assist, but sometimes those step-assist granting items add some other cool perks that we want. So this option lets you disable the step-assist part only. With optional keybind to toggle.\n\n### Master Volume Slider in Options Screen\nYes, the new volume settings screen is cool. But couldn't you have kept the Master Volume slider on the main settings screen as well? After years of research I have concluded that you can, so I added it back. Saved you a click.\n\n### Music Volume Slider in Options Screen\nMade up user studies have shown that the average player will much more frequently want to turn off the music than change the master volume, so our team of highly experienced quantum programmers have also brought the music slider back to the main settings screen\n\n![](https://blay09.net/files/brand/clienttweaks_settings.png)","published":"2022-06-14T18:20:46.900416Z","updated":"2023-12-29T09:02:33.673890Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":257331,"followers":273,"categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["T0tustVF","SoUkWRKx","fK62VmwY","IjPL1T1N","Mz7eeTEe","gN1XVFx6","rlQ7mQes","Fhy3pE8g","fxUm9n5z","C46Y48g4","EmDsfaiv","almeE46g","FKfK6YfH","onfW0a04","ofJ9s6y0","iM86WEvk","L3su862e","kiZkKw4d","3zMCvvSv","7Zzx91AW","gUwtFfmz","x2nEWOgf","OranQBcj","uSdTs5qr","eSkate4P","Usk9UOE5","C8zlAwG9","L8ES7as6","rfluucsd","IMQ65mCI","ecFWvFOq","ilefH4JG","HgyiFYdI"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vPNqo58Q/78a0ae61d366c770fd2c19dab595a045a2d0c106.png"},"version":{"id":"7Zzx91AW","project_id":"vPNqo58Q","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"11.1.0+forge-1.20","version_number":"11.1.0+forge-1.20","changelog":"-

It is based on the last FOSS-licensed version of the Sodium codebase, and includes additional bugfixes & features for better mod compatibility.\n\nDespite being forked from Sodium, Embeddium is **not supported by CaffeineMC**. Do not report issues encountered with it to their bug tracker or in their Discord. I have my own [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) for my mods.\n\n## Highlights\n\n* All performance improvements from Sodium 0.5.8 and earlier, i.e. a rewritten terrain renderer, various optimizations to the immediate-mode rendering pipeline (used by entities, GUIs, block entities, etc.), and other miscellaneous improvements\n* Available for Minecraft Forge on 1.20.1 and older, and Fabric/NeoForge on 1.20.1 and newer\n* Integrated Fabric Rendering API support (Indium is no longer required, and will not work with Embeddium)\n* Frequent patch updates to fix mod compatibility issues soon after being reported & reproduced\n* Additional APIs for mod integration\n* Optional support for translucency sorting (can be enabled in Video Settings)\n\n## For developers\n\nIf you're looking to add Embeddium to your development environment, please take a look at the [dedicated wiki page](https://github.com/embeddedt/embeddium/wiki/For-Developers) for instructions & recommended guidelines for integration.\n\n## Credits\n\n* JellySquid & the CaffeineMC team, for making Sodium in the first place, without which this project would not be possible\n* Asek3, for the initial port to Forge\n* XFactHD, for providing a list of gamebreaking Rubidium issues to start this work off, and for testing early builds\n* Pepper, for their invaluable assistance with getting Forge lighting to work on Sodium 0.5\n* @CelestialAbyss and @input-Here for making the new logo design\n\n## License\n\nEmbeddium is distributed under the Lesser GNU General Public License version 3.

Most of them are not your usual light hitting vanilla monsters, so be ready to face a new challenge after sunset!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/enderzoology/strip.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/commons/headers/features.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"32\" /></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The enderminy is like a tiny sibiling of the enderman. Packs quite a punch when provoked and likes chasing after concussion creepers.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Concussion creepers are a new variant of creepers. While their explosions won't destroy terrain, you'll instead end up in a different place. Drops confusing powder which can be used to craft charges, new variants of TNT which apply effects similar to the concussion creeper itself.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Fallen knights are a crossover between a zombie and a skeleton. They spawn with both melee and ranged weapons and hit very hard. Some even ride into battle on a special mount. Rarely ranged knights will drop their special hunting bow, which is unique in that in addition to normal bow enchantments it can also receive all crossbow enchantments, namely quick charge, multishot and piercing.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The fallen mount is what fallen knights ride into battle on. Similar to zombie horses, those creatures are not passive though. Even after their rider has perished these evil beasts will still chase after you. If you're careful you can heal one though just like a villager zombie and make it your own mount.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The wither witch is an evil variant of vanilla's witch: You'll occasionally be attacked with a potion that gives the wither effect! Better keep a distance from this one! Use the wither powder you get after defeating suchc a witch to brew your very own wither potions and get your revenge next time!</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">And the wither witch usually does not come alone: With it comes the wither cat. While looking like a cute little kitty at first glance, once you come a little closer you'll soon realize that this wasn't such a good idea after all.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The infested zombie is a cross between a zombie and an enderman. It's a tricky enemy: Whenever it lands a hit the target might just teleport away! It's still an enemy worth defeating though: Rarely you'll get an enchanted book with a unique new enchantment!</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Dire wolves roam the snowy forests of your world. Easily confused with your friendly vanilla wolf, but this one isn't friendly in the slightest. Just run as quick as you can if you come face to face with it's red eyes.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">But not everything has to be evil: Cute owls are also added, they live in forests and hold a grudge against spiders. Use their eggs to brew a potion of rising which grants levitation.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">▶️ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Additionally there is another enchantment which you can simply receive at an enchanting table for all your tools: Soulbound! An enchanted item will simply stay in your inventory when you die. The level of the enchantment may decrease when that happens.</span></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/enderzoology/strip.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/commons/headers/media.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"32\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/enderzoology/media/1.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/enderzoology/media/2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/enderzoology/media/3.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/enderzoology/media/4.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/enderzoology/media/5.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/enderzoology/media/6.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/enderzoology/strip.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/commons/headers/installation.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"32\" /></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">⏩ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">INSTALLATION REQUIRED ON CLIENT &amp; REQUIRED ON SERVER</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">⏩ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">REQUIRES </span></strong><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzles-lib\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">PUZZLES LIB</span></strong></a><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> TO BE INSTALLED (FORGE &amp; FABRIC)</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">⏩ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">REQUIRES </span></strong><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">FABRIC API</span></strong></a><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> TO BE INSTALLED (FABRIC)</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">⏩ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">REQUIRES </span></strong><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/forge-config-api-port\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">FORGE CONFIG API PORT</span></strong></a><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> TO BE INSTALLED (FABRIC)</span></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/enderzoology/strip.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/commons/headers/configuration.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"32\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Configuration is easily possible directly from in-game using the mod menu (requires </span><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Mod Menu</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> by </span><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/prospectordev\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Prospector</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> to be installed on Fabric) by installing either </span><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/configured\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Configured</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> or </span><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/configured-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Configured (Fabric)</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> by </span><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/mrcrayfish\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">MrCrayfish</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">When it comes to manual configuration all files are found at </span><code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">.minecraft/config</span></code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">, named as </span><code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">MOD_ID-client.toml</span></code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">, </span><code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">MOD_ID-common.toml</span></code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">, or </span><code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">MOD_ID-server.toml</span></code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> depending on the type of config.

All leaves are gone after about one second (configurable). That's it, nothing special about it so far!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Why another leaf decay mod? Aren't there like a dozen already?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure, but this one is different for sure.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Out Of The Box Mod Compat:</strong> All mods that register their leaves in the <code>minecraft:leaves</code> tag are automatically supported, even when their leaves don't extend vanilla Minecraft's leaves block (e.g. some of the large trees in the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrestria\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Terrestria</span></a> mod by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/coderbot\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">coderbot</span></a>).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>No Additional Block Updates/Block State Checks:</strong> Leaves Be Gone is extremely efficient when determining which leaves blocks to accelerate decay for. It hooks in just where vanilla decides when a leaves block is able to decay, so it doesn't have to do any calculations on it's own. Also no additional calculations are made elsewhere, like when harvesting logs or when other leaves blocks decay as in other mods.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Works Properly Across Chunk/Level Reloads:</strong> Scheduled leaf decays are stored using Minecraft's native system for scheduling ticks (no custom hacky solution required!), so when undloading and reloading the area leaf decay continues as it should without having to repeat any calculations.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/813/2022-10-06_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/814/2022-10-06_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Redwood tree leaves be gone!</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>So many drops!</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;

Finally you can build the castle of your dreams without limits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Please note that for technical reasons when installing the Diagonal Walls mod walls are no longer able to connect upwards and will once again show gaps when stacked vertically (like they used to in Minecraft 1.15.2 and before). Adding that feature back is unfortunatly not technically feasible and is not planned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Blocks added by other mods are dynamically supported whenever possible.

Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it!

Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft client, and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting systems on the client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will only remain effective on the client side if the server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of NoChatReports, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n\n## Installation and Usage:\n\nNoChatReports supports both Fabric and Forge, just download the version for your respective modloader and game version. It can be installed on either the client, server, or on both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present on:\n\n**1. Only Client:** The client will refuse to send the account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof that they were actually sent from your account. The server will relay them unless the `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to `true` in the `server.properties` file (which it is by default since 1.19.1)\n\nIf the server does require you to sign messages and you are on either 1.19.1 or 1.19.2, you will not be able to join the server unless you agree to send signed messages (NoChatReports will supply a warning screen), if you are on 1.19.3 or higher, you will still be able to join the server, but will not be able to use chat-related commands (other commands do still work)\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but the server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable the conversion of player to system messages in the config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\nAs of 1.20.2 the server cannot disable the \"unsigned messages\" warning on the client. It can only be disabled if the client has NoChatReports (or a similar mod) installed.\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signatures will be stripped on the client side before sending messages to the server, which will not attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough NoChatReports can function when it is only present on one of either sides, NoChatReports can be configured to demand itself to be installed on the respective other side in order to play. This way you can install it on the server and require all clients that join to have NoChatReports installed, but you can also leave it server-only if you prefer.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on the client, NoChatReports will disable Telemetry (similar to what [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make sure that your server is compatible with NoChatReports, you can take a look at [this part of the wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players).\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe configuration files are located in the `NoChatReports` subfolder of the default config folder.\n\n`NCR-Client.json` stores Client-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Common.json` stores Server-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Encryption.json` stores Chat Encryption settings (Only effective on the client)\n\n`NCR-ServerPreferences.json` stores Per-Server Signing Modes\n\nYou can find more information [here](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/).\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to Chat Encryption, watching it will help you to learn how it is used (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features the following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make clients with No Chat Reports installed recognize servers running your software as safe. I wrote [a small article](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status) about this. For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3.

The purpose is to provide functionality for developers to add extra accessory/equipment slots in a convenient and compatible manner, as well as to give users the ability to configure these slots to their preferences. By default, Curios does not add any content except for an inventory GUI. There are no slots and only two items, the latter only being available through the Creative menu and primarily serving as examples for developers to use when coding their own integration.\n\n## Features\n* **Expandable equipment slots through a central library.** New equipment slots can be made and managed easily through an identifier registry. Identical identifiers will be merged together to avoid functional redundancies and provide maximum compatibility to potential items, while unique identifiers can still be used to mark special types when appropriate.\n* **Slots are only made on-demand.** There are no slots included by default, all slots are created only as needed. This reduces instances where one or more superfluous slots are present without any suitable items to go into the slot.\n* **Slots are completely customizable and manipulable.** Slots can have custom backgrounds, different sizes, and can even be disabled or hidden by default. But how would a player even access disabled slots? Through the API, developers can access functions to enable/disable a player's slots or add/remove a certain number of slots of a given type.\n* **Flexible item->curio relations using the vanilla tag system.** Potential curios are selected through the vanilla tag system, which means that categorizing items into curio types is as easy as creating a .json file in the data/curios/tags folder. Items can be categorized into as many curio types as you want as long as they're tagged in the appropriate files, and these settings can even be overridden entirely. For more information, see the vanilla tag system.\n* **Complete integration with other inventory mechanics.** Mending and Curses will work with all applicable items equipped in the curio slots. There are also various minor features for developers that make it simpler to integrate their current items or mechanics into the curio system.\n* **Accessible from a single GUI.** Curios comes with its own GUI accessible from the inventory that shows all of the available slots to a player. This allows players to see all of the extended equipment slots in a central location without needing to access different inventory GUIs.

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server.

Smooth Boot (Reloaded) solves this problem completely, and loading should be much smoother and potentially faster as well.\n\n### Features\n\nChange amount of threads used for loading\nChange priority of threads used by Minecraft\n\n### How the mod works\n\nMinecraft uses executors to run multithreaded tasks. The problem is that the tasks that are ran during loading are quite heavy on the CPU, so it leads to 100% CPU usage. And, some of the tasks do not necessarily benefit from multithreading. Smooth Boot fixes these problems by change the parameters of the executors, including the number of threads they use and the priority of each thread.\n\nFor more information, please read the [Smooth Boot (Reloaded) wiki](https://github.com/AbdElAziz333/SmoothBoot-Reloaded/wiki).\n\n### Modpack Permissions\n\nSmooth Boot (Reloaded) is a free and open-source project on Modrinth, and as such-- of course you can include it in your modpack!\n\n### Issues and Feature Requests\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the bottom of the page to report bugs, crashes, and if you want to propose new features or otherwise contribute to the mod, i will gladly accept pull requests, as well!\n\nIf you want to support me, use my code **AbdElAziz333** to get 25% off your first month and enjoy playing with your friends!\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.imgur.com/ytD8AVA.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/AbdElAziz333)\n\n**Thanks!**","published":"2022-11-02T05:54:53.998919Z","updated":"2024-01-08T01:33:06.845232Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":222082,"followers":143,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["e9Hq3hbv","3yzqBh3Y","qmq8DyRI","YXklcDpN","CSAWSThG","FpT1xZyZ","iGVkOHlW","gCz8FYyg","FzbfQajL","HkfL3iGO"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/z53V2L4P/72c932a650b6ca3830a1dd82ee86eb7f05f589ef.png"},"version":{"id":"HkfL3iGO","project_id":"z53V2L4P","author_id":"3AXCrCqA","featured":false,"name":"Smooth Boot (Reloaded) 0.0.4 for MC 1.20.1","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.0.4","changelog":"This update uses a specific amount of main worker threads you can change it in the config, while the old updates uses the number of the available threads, resulting in worse performance.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-08T01:33:07.890390Z","downloads":51375,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"1cf706491339f3efae0d48d0dd596f27a74fcfa8e94008d7ef55e18be8c6f3c437bb74020e48910e1cc724ad35894bffce94788fe8f765c37048d4cc532ba261","sha1":"3fd79132dba444bd109b5de4ad75dee06a48e130"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/z53V2L4P/versions/HkfL3iGO/smoothboot%28reloaded%29-mc1.20.1-0.0.4.jar","filename":"smoothboot(reloaded)-mc1.20.1-0.0.4.jar","primary":true,"size":41044,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"nBB8t1rq","user":{"id":"3AXCrCqA","username":"AbdElAziz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89092953?v=4","bio":"I love all people","created":"2022-05-27T22:49:23.800376Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"smoothboot(reloaded)-mc1.20.1-0.0.4.jar"},"mods\\cloth-config-11.1.118-forge.jar":{"sha512":"5f8017fb496e65ce25ecb249927602d578fc235fc80c5db335e071ee9c108680b3c8c1f82dfafaf21c90e46a174b6717a3946feea5295a3c8ace5b11201ff7c5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"9s6osm5g","slug":"cloth-config","project_type":"mod","team":"z9omIQMN","title":"Cloth Config API","description":"Configuration Library for Minecraft Mods","body":"[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZEORx0F.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\"/>](https://discord.gg/Vs9AVkxjYY) [<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LrVLC2a.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"201\"/>](https://www.patreon.com/shedaniel)\n\nCloth Config API is a config screen api.\n\n### Developers Wiki\n[https://shedaniel.gitbook.io/cloth-config/](https://shedaniel.gitbook.io/cloth-config/)\n\nNeed a server to play with friends?

No need for placing the whole box on the ground for checking contents or adding a few item stacks! When you want to extract an item, easily scroll through all items in the box to get what you want. And believe it or not, this works with Ender Chests, too!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0ssWwh-owo\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Shulker Boxes and Ender Chests are so damn useful for storing and transporting many items. But why do you always have to place them on the floor to use them? Time to change that!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In any interface, simply hold shift when hovering the container item and you'll <strong>see all of its contents</strong> in the item tooltip. And if you just quickly want to add a few items, simply <strong>right-click them on the box/chest item in your inventory</strong>. You can do the same without holding an item to <strong>extract items from a box/chest</strong>. To control which item you extract simply use the scrolling wheel to cycle through all the contents. Very useful!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/577/2022-03-13_10.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/578/2022-03-13_10.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Right-click a shulker box item to extract contents stack by stack</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Hold shift to see contents of a shulker box in your inventory</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2024-05-01T07:54:45.503978Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1477688,"followers":1680,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader","neoforge"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR","LABx1dmK","mjuG4AYd","LG14xw1O","7nm8NrSL","1n3YehcE","nWbxhour"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"stb5nE30","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20–1.20.1

Developers:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; white-space: pre;\"><strong>This guide should only be used if you are a developer wanting to using Blueprint in your mod. If you're a player, you may disregard this guide.</strong><br />Adding Blueprint to your mod is quite simple! First off you need to add Blueprint as a dependency to access the library in code. To do so, add the following into your <code>build.gradle</code>: <br /><br /><code>\nrepositories {<br />\n    maven {<br />\n        url = \"https://maven.jaackson.me\"<br />\n    }<br />\n}<br />\n<br />\ndependencies {<br />\n    implementation fg.deobf(\"com.teamabnormals:blueprint:&lt;version&gt;\")<br />\n}\n      </code><br /> <br />Next you need to add it as a dependecy on Forge to make your mod require Blueprint when loading. In your <code>mods.toml</code> add the following block to the file:<br /><br /><code>\n[[dependencies.&lt;modId&gt;]]<br />\n    modId = \"blueprint\"<br />\n    mandatory = true<br />\n    versionRange = \"[&lt;version&gt;,)\"<br />\n    ordering = \"BEFORE\"<br />\n    side = \"BOTH\"\n      </code><br /><br />Replace <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> in the examples above with the version on you want. For example, <code>1.17.1-4.0.0</code> will give us <code>blueprint-1.17.1-4.0.0.jar</code>. The example for the <code>mods.toml</code> is targeting the version selected and any versions beyond. If you want to target it differently, you may want to read up on the <code>mods.toml</code> spec. </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/U7uo5Va.png\" width=\"1344\" height=\"48\" /></p>\n<p><a title=\"Nodecraft\" href=\"https://nodecraft.com/r/abnormals\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oZS1R9g.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"184\" /></a></p>","published":"2023-09-18T17:11:12.586856Z","updated":"2024-04-26T03:53:44.539845Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":47484,"followers":64,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["LeFEEsj6","SnLXbWe9","W7LnjQML","aCCwv4Kz","mnMEKjNd","fEmF971j","L7ot1xtH","fHbqAHAN","brtkxg5j","l3Z9H5ed","LkOcOC7A"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/VsM5EDoI/9311df94e37aa2c7a39cce14d118a263862fe9e5.png"},"version":{"id":"l3Z9H5ed","project_id":"VsM5EDoI","author_id":"3u8PgG8F","featured":false,"name":"Blueprint 7.0.3","version_number":"7.0.3","changelog":"- Added BlockSetType registry helper\n- Fixed issues with Chiseled Bookshelves","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-01T18:20:16.905237Z","downloads":4622,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"0c087a746637414167e21da1bed649197b494f6f","sha512":"87b1167d174539f15d43f4d02d3371567459234ccbc2c5a63ec833fc21779020944f5ee5782892119d101c62f223eb39effa59854c50f11ca0bee57efd1f47c7"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/VsM5EDoI/versions/l3Z9H5ed/blueprint-1.20.1-7.0.3.jar","filename":"blueprint-1.20.1-7.0.3.jar","primary":true,"size":1080111,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"nmCECwLn","user":{"id":"3u8PgG8F","username":"bagel","name":"bagel","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/3u8PgG8F/e3f9a37360125857fc9bd09b7e36fd6ffe3cafeb.png","bio":"minecraft modder and coder and yeaher","created":"2021-04-29T17:41:22.849292Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"nmCECwLn","user":{"id":"P53hwL9b","username":"SmellyModder","name":"Luke Tonon","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/P53hwL9b/02d85c2d067251dc276beec1c53ebf4ae05bcfb8.png","bio":"Software Developer, Game Developer, and Modder.\r\nMaking dreams come true.","created":"2023-09-18T18:52:46.978373Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0}],"update_version":{"id":"LkOcOC7A","project_id":"VsM5EDoI","author_id":"3u8PgG8F","featured":false,"name":"Blueprint 7.1.0","version_number":"7.1.0","changelog":"* Added BlueprintTrims, an API for adding Trim Materials, Trim Patterns, and Trimmable Armor in a compatible way\n* Added BlueprintBlockStateProvider, BlueprintItemModelProvider, BlueprintRecipeProvider, and BlueprintLanguageProvider for some baseline datagen utils\n* Reworked Blueprint's system for adding new Rabbit variants\n* Implemented EggLayer interface to help mods integrate their egg laying animals together better\n* Added various tags to help categorize some blocks, items, and damage types\n* Simplified Remolder pack targeting","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-26T03:53:45.025418Z","downloads":5597,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"5ff3b2c8ff096d6481ed252f0371aeb60b460f27","sha512":"cb788eb25834e601f3c59cf9af9eeb30416a4ee9a87fafb6f5abbbea7f97f66b7197b20a57988fe365ba1a122292194bdb73ce0e0aa8af1a0318080a74495652"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/VsM5EDoI/versions/LkOcOC7A/blueprint-1.20.1-7.1.0.jar","filename":"blueprint-1.20.1-7.1.0.jar","primary":true,"size":1141553,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"incompatible":true},"file_name":"blueprint-1.20.1-7.0.3.jar"},"mods\\LegendaryTooltips-1.20.1-forge-1.4.5.jar":{"sha512":"20d973e57ac7c20fe8f3a6f5cd75b46d3362a7f7ec408750f15894ce98c14174f083535abeff8640c21e53411cceef6387442141bf98a694b0e3ba4d18804257","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"atHH8NyV","slug":"legendary-tooltips","project_type":"mod","team":"80MpFuhC","title":"Legendary Tooltips","description":"Give your rare items a fancier tooltip!

The main inspiration comes from scrapped illustrations for what was _supposed_ to be the Wild Update — this is essentially a collection of small improvements without any new blocks, items, or even biomes.\n\nIt is a different edition of [Geophilic](https://modrinth.com/mod/geophilic) meant to be compatible with *all* biomes, vanilla and modded, in some way or another, but with primary focus on harmony with [Biomes O' Plenty](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/biomes-o-plenty).\n\nHere's a short overview of the changes Geophilic Reforged makes:\n\n- Some vanilla trees, such as oak, spruce, and birch, grow taller\n- Tree stumps and fallen trees appear in a plethora of different wooded biomes\n- Moss grows in deciduous and coniferous forests on logs, rocks and podzol\n- Small bushes grow in some forests, plain and plateau biomes\n- Boulders (known in Minecraft as forest rocks) of different kinds are now commonplace\n- Patches of podzol, coarse dirt, stone, or other blocks, can be found in certain biomes\n- Grass is much denser practically everywhere, with density depending on biome type\n- Certain biomes or biome types include special features unique to them!\n\nSee pictures — a picture is worth at least *two* words, maybe even more! Especially in this case, since, frankly, not that many changes are even necessary to make biomes that much better.\n\nIf you don't play with biome mods, use classic Geophilic, but you can use this instead if you want. Both work, although they are a bit different. Up to you :)\n\nI hope you like it!\n\n### Technical details 📋\n\n⚠ **This mod is not intended to be used alongside classic Geophilic.** Please remove Geophilic before using this mod. Your world will not get corrupted, but make a backup anyway!\n\n⚠ **Requires the Forge mod-loader, even when used as a data pack.** It won't work in vanilla.\n\nDue to the nature of this mod (and my lack of knowledge of Java as well as of time to learn it, but *shhh*), features that *require* new blocks added by mods (think modded fallen trees needing a modded log) might not be present. That said, it might not be that big a deal, since features like rocks and vegetation will be added nonetheless. If it looks like a mod isn't supported, make sure the mod tags its biomes correctly.\n\n**Still in development.** New versions might differ. Won't break your save, though. *Or will it?* 🤨\n\n### Supported mods 📁\n\nThese are some biome mods that this mod works best with:\n\n- Biomes O' Plenty\n- Windswept\n- Traverse Reforged\n\n**Please don't ask whether or not this mod is compatible with some other biome mod, it most likely is.**\n\nThis mod doesn't change biome colours. If that's something you're looking for, use [Quark](https://modrinth.com/mod/quark)'s Greener Grass feature, which allows full customization of all natural colours and works really well.\n","published":"2023-11-12T22:14:43.083203Z","updated":"2024-04-27T19:19:10.333778Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":58763,"followers":50,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":["adventure"],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5"],"loaders":["datapack","forge"],"versions":["NTAlpgEm","gE3AuTTV","zDOO8z5o","QICWfEz6","CWjCfYL9","VF0bzh6B","xrTNii5M","7IKbpUj8"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/d47NdDkH/00b0228d066ce169b44ef95a6b20bd4c4467fdd6.png"},"version":{"id":"VF0bzh6B","project_id":"d47NdDkH","author_id":"iDSnCeE7","featured":false,"name":"v1.2.0.jar","version_number":"1.2.0","changelog":"This is the version you probably want!!","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-18T12:36:15.700020Z","downloads":57397,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"95ae991693b91965958129f2e850751ae30e10286e49e5834282c1965579d3c66623e173a9312dc0a12dfc4e56284ef09db534f571c41849b8fb525f68af7b92","sha1":"412650ce355803e91d54ad8c44cdcf8857c09e2a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/d47NdDkH/versions/VF0bzh6B/GeophilicReforged-v1.2.0.jar","filename":"GeophilicReforged-v1.2.0.jar","primary":false,"size":381424,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"cLLVZqxx","user":{"id":"iDSnCeE7","username":"bebebea_loste","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/iDSnCeE7/6f26603efa3d20c686f74c2d25250974ec369555.jpeg","bio":"I like Minecraft!

Gap Fix","description":"Fixes gaps in Block Models and Item Models","body":"Model Gap FIX\n\n \n\nThis is a simple client mod that fixes https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-73186\n\nwhich affects both Block Models and Item Models and possibly other models too\n\n \n\nThe mod works by removing texture zooming, making every model face use 100% of its texture, unlike of what it did previoulsly.\n\nThisnot only fixes this bugs on items (where it's most noticeable) but with block models too and everything else that might use those functions.\n\n \n\nThis issue was especially noticeable with custom block models or some 2d items.\n\n \n\n \n\nQ&A:\n\n- Will this slow down my game? \n\nNot at all! Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs\n\n- How does this work?\n\nThe base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately \"fixes up\" all those problematic gaps on models.\nFor 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly.

Once you have at least 12 eyes, you can follow them until you reach the Stronghold. You have to put <strong>the 12 custom eyes in the portal in order to open it</strong>. If there's a vanilla eye of ender in one of the frames, you can remove it by right clicking on it with a custom eye.</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><br /></span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PuRYpVn.png\" alt=\"The Eyes\" width=\"1042\" height=\"174\" /></span><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Eyes are a really important part of End Remastered, just like Vanilla Ender Eyes, they allow you to activate the portal to the End. However, unlike Vanilla Ender Eyes, they are not dropped by Endermen, but must be found by exploring, fighting and mining.

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at [@BlayTheNinth](https://twitter.com/BlayTheNinth).","published":"2022-06-14T18:11:16.556742Z","updated":"2024-05-08T18:48:58.699526Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1831162,"followers":687,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["yIf5KdB1","C0Q1coDV","OxgGZ2zM","DIjNWWDQ","3FaeA4B3","pLCLIILr","KHoU8dQ1","U6WiexwY","KGco8pn9","3gG05xht","yCm0MvD8","bv4c7vz6","HaskpkVN","rLFLPShY","vtPaYjej","jLBnf4l1","i5Q1d7Pr","TQMftlzA","ZI4feWbU","SLR7Xv0p","AhzvhBQj","oqGuqpwK","DENsCzBf","nErKcTp9","xAQtenTo","1pxcbuZv","840UhUoL","9XoBRgjV","6X6csbpx","nFs2ZvOR","NhlpDRNn","zq3nXKQW","TbFmWuAA","O2nbMbp5","C60k8eYK","XYqAzGqP","XNus763a","qUWyGBdD","RAATKbAN","uATqqu4e","lRKNKP0w","ONL5pq9r","FDkt1ohj","o7IqP6Td","DAOUt1Jg","VYTPVkW0","RXK9iX99","wiayzjLV","rbUpGzGA","i8CwYuCi","I5betUED","NRF4uKO7","c1GjX2k1","Zq0Ko2UQ","d7a0S3hj","l551HLmO","BLkvfQ2x","CO57SmJl","ffUlrjOr","jdk8u9nq","x70MCuv3","sBs7NeXN","BJ0Uk3Di","fFosgnEu","qHXzOzUv","YL5MVHnr","N4NxIVYC","jPAtAJcJ","RYxPLFUw","NMOJStju","qIAY6mKt","JUrMdJP1","VIE9sG8O","f6LbzxNL","TGc6wvHK","lt2lEcIY","1hau5QwF","VH4LTqFp","H0a9rBTV","6ryA9MPE","Q0xpW61Y","hDWb6gW2","7rTXTEe7","uZyJkfxk","SLbLamWu","ZuihLitZ","C95JH5YK","zXq0pj5R","VhfHxcat","2OHf9GyZ","QiuQRA7s","kjIgNYGA","tC2vMFuQ","AUJXa9xo","v1tAteat","fzqus8s0","U79V1VMr","OjHYTM4n","z5z8sM4m","ctu48FWB","StgsQbVh","vFLrqKU8","2e2nF2M9","WYvcCUer","Rr2heMKC"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MBAkmtvl/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"fzqus8s0","project_id":"MBAkmtvl","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"7.2.2+forge-1.20.1","version_number":"7.2.2+forge-1.20.1","changelog":"- Fixed some models on Fabric not being loaded correctly","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-27T16:59:07.012553Z","downloads":75617,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"c0bb062b52fa0a234d922e066d3e09c3df4297d9","sha512":"447ff1031896744f82e0dde010945a4bcf82f0edce88dee2721c548ca64df40f7fa97e7d2abbe81f74b44339d8a336823afff17811885f773af1bc09f9ecd79d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MBAkmtvl/versions/fzqus8s0/balm-forge-1.20.1-7.2.2.jar","filename":"balm-forge-1.20.1-7.2.2.jar","primary":true,"size":343714,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"c1tw4qzj","user":{"id":"WE4nCeiO","username":"BlayTheNinth","name":"BlayTheNinth","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1933180?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-28T14:04:06.205061Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"balm-forge-1.20.1-7.2.2.jar"},"mods\\emoji-type-2.2.3+1.20.4-forge.jar":{"sha512":"5bba870d09e6f7163ce5196a79b572f0b344e7845af49ab7d20efbea1f8c64f88120b950331256fe4ad8dd05553665ca17141c3ee45095950961086c05bf84c1","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"q7vRRpxU","slug":"emoji-type","project_type":"mod","team":"W500OHL3","title":"Emoji Type","description":"Allows you to easily type emoji and emoticons in game.","body":"# 🙂 Emoji Type\n_We support 100+ symbols/emojis by default!_ <br>\n\nThis mod allows you to type some emoji/symbols more easily in Minecraft. To be clear, this mod (technically) does not add any emoji to the game, it only makes typing the ones _already in the game_ easier. For this reason, emoji typed will be visible to anyone else on a server and will still be there (on signs, books, etc) if you uninstall the mod. I can not absolutely guarantee all symbols/emoji will work on all servers, some servers have plugins that mess with chat and there is really nothing I can do about that. **This is a client-side mod. Installing it on a server won't do anything.**\n\n### Typing Emojis\nTo type an emoji in chat, simply type a \":\" (colon), after that a list of all possible emoji keywords will appear. Once you type a keyword it will be replaced with the corresponding emoji or symbol. If you want to type an emoji outside of chat (anvil, sign, etc) the list won't appear but the keywords all still work.\n\n### Gallery\n<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/emoji-type/gallery\">**Images of example mod usage**</a>","published":"2022-02-01T16:35:05.166164Z","updated":"2024-05-07T20:44:05.161761Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":261317,"followers":343,"categories":["decoration","social","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["XdckHhpz","Ht2hM8Xq","UOUu888G","OClBPG5J","zI92sPKy","CK7AQM79","JrJcKrVe","cPZUFyn3","CEkPXkXm","qfTOKc0t","UcvY1ouv","LDTBjvLi","q3ICvlUh","vxFNEeJM","KeZkpifk","EG9qtsGU","sAVbywwx","fOQkMciT","56RYN3J9","vMemC90R","uI750kzO","SDBfBuH9","bOTB1mD7","TJdSeIXP","sDwPKoLM","J1r39edy","ZoSYDHSL"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/q7vRRpxU/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"sDwPKoLM","project_id":"q7vRRpxU","author_id":"eD3uN1NK","featured":false,"name":"NeoForge 2.2.3+1.20-1.20.2","version_number":"2.2.3+1.20.4","changelog":"Fixed support for NeoForge below 1.20.2!\n\n_NeoForge rebranded to NeoForge on 1.20.2 so on older versions there is `forge` modid._","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-09T14:07:56.862739Z","downloads":1810,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"5bba870d09e6f7163ce5196a79b572f0b344e7845af49ab7d20efbea1f8c64f88120b950331256fe4ad8dd05553665ca17141c3ee45095950961086c05bf84c1","sha1":"ffdb409f32211fe3ad77b4f2bafd7c0f2195beaa"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/q7vRRpxU/versions/sDwPKoLM/emoji-type-2.2.3%2B1.20.4-neoforge.jar","filename":"emoji-type-2.2.3+1.20.4-neoforge.jar","primary":false,"size":28212,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"W500OHL3","user":{"id":"rjT4u2Xf","username":"cyborgcabbage","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29862837?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-09-02T14:45:33.458699Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Original Creator","ordering":0},{"team_id":"W500OHL3","user":{"id":"eD3uN1NK","username":"Norbiros","name":"Norbiros","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89837724?v=4","bio":"Norbiros#0730","created":"2022-08-28T09:10:41.179374Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":{"id":"bOTB1mD7","project_id":"q7vRRpxU","author_id":"eD3uN1NK","featured":true,"name":"Forge 2.2.3+1.20-1.20.4","version_number":"2.2.3+1.20.4","changelog":"- Update to new architectury plugin version\n- Add support for 1.20.3 and 1.20.4\n\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-15T18:46:02.461475Z","downloads":6668,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"5bba870d09e6f7163ce5196a79b572f0b344e7845af49ab7d20efbea1f8c64f88120b950331256fe4ad8dd05553665ca17141c3ee45095950961086c05bf84c1","sha1":"ffdb409f32211fe3ad77b4f2bafd7c0f2195beaa"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/q7vRRpxU/versions/bOTB1mD7/emoji-type-2.2.3%2B1.20.4-forge.jar","filename":"emoji-type-2.2.3+1.20.4-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":28212,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge"]},"incompatible":true},"file_name":"emoji-type-2.2.3+1.20.4-forge.jar"},"mods\\PortableHole-v8.0.0-1.20.1-Forge.jar":{"sha512":"2f7d1494f0f0286299180f8126fde1cebf86ff7b14b3a905cc656a771695207e3004498efbca660505700c679e3b1eb9d93d55aedb7f8cc00a4841438fb52fd4","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"jckrUoUe","slug":"portable-hole","project_type":"mod","team":"Cp63XMee","title":"Portable Hole","description":"Where did the walls go?","body":"<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Lk8bHYP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"240\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Zvh47yt.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;

Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for

Trades","description":"Allows easy customization of villager trades using datapacks","body":"[ISSUES]: https://github.com/PssbleTrngle/DataTrades/issues\n\n[DOWNLOAD]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/data-trades/files\n\n[CURSEFORGE]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/data-trades\n\n[MODRINTH]: https://modrinth.com/mod/data-trades\n\n# Data Trades \n\nThis mod adds the ability for players, serverowners or modpack creators to overwrite villager trades using datapacks.\nThe amount of trades per level and the actual items traded can be customized using json files.\nA command for development purposes called `/villagers refresh` will manually trigger a re-asign of trades to all loaded villagers.\n\n\n## Folder Structure\n\nUsing a datapack, the trades of a specific villager profession can be overwritten by creating a JSON file following this\npattern:\n\n```\ndata/[namespace]/villager/professions/[path].json\n```\n\n`[namespace]` and `[path]` should be overwritten by the specific villager professions ID.\nFor example, to create trades for the `minecraft:fletcher` profession,\na file under `data/minecraft/villager/professions/fletcher.json` should be created.\nIt's content should follow the [*Profession*](#profession) Schema\n\nSimilar, the wandering trader can be overwritten by adding a file at\n```\ndata/minecraft/villager/traders/wandering.json\n```\nfollowing the [*Trader*](#trader) Schema\n\n## Examples\n\nDatapacks with examples can be found [here](https://github.com/PssbleTrngle/DataTrades/tree/1.19/datapacks).\n\n## JSON Schema\n\nThe JSON file should contain an object with these

`Ingredient` with a few extra properties.\nThey can take the form of an item or tag and specify all properties of the vanilla Ingredient JSON.\nSince Villager trades are `ItemStack` based that does not mean that a player can pay a `#minecraft:stone_tool_materials`\nwith any stone type, but only the one that is randomly selected from the tag each time the trade is used.\n\n| Property  | Type

takes the form of a map with numeric keys and object values.\nThe keys represent the actual villagers level with *1* being *Novice* until *5* being *Master*.\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\nInstead of a `Trade` object, the TradeLevel `trades` property can also contain *string* IDs referencing an external\ntrade.\nThese trades can be saved under the path below to organize & reuse them.\n\n```\ndata/[namespace]/villager/trades/[path].json\n```","published":"2023-07-19T14:31:13.898673Z","updated":"2023-09-27T13:15:57.737941Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":694,"followers":17,"categories":["economy","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["kRyAsaKB","51yLwhqJ","POWadHtC","6oNh8yxD","EdrsCutN","ol6nxW1C","BhATWEFZ","9WsLcYKp","1fuAJlgS","axaRKrwK","Quwt9wWG","2RNzlrAc","TNhvYAPj","EQ9J8YfE","s0gpSY3m","xycPMa8D","wvKdcu6T","sdpTBtwn","IekZyBnK","vqk4ulIO","f0egOeSn","IBQf6Auw","moCWIRJ3","74bS0ghR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/nm1MuVrD/40694f4c35327e93cb37ce1a627a316dcb929d52.png"},"version":{"id":"74bS0ghR","project_id":"nm1MuVrD","author_id":"qxswSLtS","featured":false,"name":"Forge

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/visual-workbench-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Does this work with crafting tables from other mods?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes, it does, but support has to be manually enabled per block. Many modded crafting tables are supported by default, those that are not can be added to a custom config file found at <code>.minecraft/config/visual_workbench.json</code> (not accessible from in-game). If you add a crafting table yourself and it doesn't work it is likely incompatible with this mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Now that items stay in the table, clearing the interface is so tedious. What can I do?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Try <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafting-tweaks\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Crafting Tweaks</span></a>, a mod by <a

is a datapack that completely revamps the nether, way more than what Minecraft did in the 1.16 Nether Update.\n\n![Incendium Banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224804955-2c8a39b1-d015-462b-a28c-dde27f747c90.png)\n\n## Notes\n- Incendium has an optional resourcepack called [Sparkles](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/sparkles)! This is __not__ required, but it allows all items to have their own beautiful textures.\n- Incendium is **not** compatible with Amplified Nether\n- Do not add this to an existing nether - reset yours first, or use a new world\n- View the structures and biomes per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)\n\n## Description\n### Biomes\nIncendium adds 8 unique biomes to the nether. Do you bravely venture through the perilous **Quartz Flats**, wander the mysterious **Withered Forest**, or battle your way through the steep **Infernal Dunes**? Each biome has a unique personality and story to tell. With unique block themes in each biomes, opportunities for new farms for technical players, 3D biomes, and stunning terrain, there is truly something for everyone.\n\n### Structures\nTo compliment the lovely biomes, there are 9+ structures for you to explore and conquer. In the Ash Barrens, the **Foribdden Castle** stands forbodingly, with courageous Piglins defending its treasured loot - one of the largest and complex random structures in Minecraft! Alternatively, you can conquer the ominous **Sanctum** with its illagers defending dark secrets and strong weapons. The skeleton chef Torte defends his **Quartz Kitchen**, and the Withered Director his **Nether Reactor**. What will you conquer first?\n\n### Items\nEvery mob you defeat and structure you conquer has its reward - Incendium pays you handsomely with both rick loot and custom weapons! Defeating the Hovering Inferno could earn you the **Trailblazer** - a flame-spewing bow. A high damage, but taxing **Greatsword of Sacrifice** hides within the Forbidden Castle's walls, along with the helpful **Hefty Pickaxe**. Or maybe you prefer to find the **Hazmat Suit** to protect you from all types of poisonous attacks. There are over 25 items to forge your own playstyle with!\n\n### Mobs\nNo datapack would be complete without its own mobs to fight you. The Toxic Heap is home of the agile **Toxic Slimes**, and the Withered Forest is haunted by the **Restless Spirits**. On the other hand, you could go on a rescue missue to save the **Ghastling** from the Abandoned Tower - in return, it will defend you from Ghasts. If none of this is challenging, you can summon the all-powerful **Hovering Inferno** boss for a difficult and dirty battle.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-23T00:20:14.180965Z","updated":"2023-12-07T22:25:20.713038Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":387084,"followers":598,"categories":["adventure","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["xnhu8xeb","NoanBvKE","S6fQNiYx","lS3rnfXC","nNDmHrHX","ednvmJkC","wdO4nfDE","QzTAZ3vy","4bK01rdc","g34x6icZ","OamdlEiS","QL8CxhjY","BxVLGy3y"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZVzW5oNS/65c8dcaaf260e5b2182c228a1a442c792a7c4782.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"BxVLGy3y","project_id":"ZVzW5oNS","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v5.3.4 ~ 1.20.4","version_number":"5.3.4","changelog":"# Incendium 5.3.4\n- Officially supports 1.20.3/4\n- Sanctum fixes:\n  - Skeletons will no longer spawn in the structure\n  - Fixed a small section of the maze that was 1 block too high\n  - Sanctum Guardians now wear their armor correctly\n  - Added some structure voids to slightly improve terrain adaptation (but not completely fix)\n- Greatsword of Sacrifice self-damage has been more than doubled, since armor now helps against it\n- Slightly increased the exclusion zone of Incendium structures (so they don't spawn too close to each other)\n- Toxic Slimes should finally no longer die of fall damage\n- Fixed an issue where custom potions lost their effects when using Fabric on 1.20.2\n- Added empty function file for manual compat with other datapacks","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-07T22:25:22.997630Z","downloads":187693,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"7dea928bb6c35c1a95fa5f4601cddeea08809c2b1d594159330156fe3e96f133c5047b25b71145199d2ace66411f18321678faa24f7e7b543014b487a7f665e3","sha1":"7339f4da6c9ca9ae73b0a877a0bbaec35fd17961"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZVzW5oNS/versions/BxVLGy3y/Incendium_1.20.4_v5.3.4.jar","filename":"Incendium_1.20.4_v5.3.4.jar","primary":true,"size":4185038,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"HfNmMQ9E","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Incendium_1.20.4_v5.3.4.jar"},"mods\\CutThrough-v8.0.2-1.20.1-Forge.jar":{"sha512":"62a89186a53f2cb3e4bd22252dd049152053a1ae312d6421be528ac7e5fdda2883bf5bd7ec8b57b8af69c6f952cdb804d39acf5e85ddffb1e7d1a516c98d0c1c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Dk6su9JN","slug":"cut-through","project_type":"mod","team":"Dzaa5u54","title":"Cut Through","description":"Cleanly swing through transparent blocks like tall grass to hit mobs without breaking said block.","body":"<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/cutthrough/banner.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"240\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/cutthrough/strip.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

Say goodbye to wasting your well earned levels on random enchants, and welcome a world of choice with fair costs for you hard-working Minecrafters.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cATWWPwhay4\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The enchanting infuser offers everything you require for your enchanting needs: A <strong>grand selection of enchantments</strong> of course, a <strong>beautifully designed block with neat animations</strong>, an <strong>extremely useful and compact interface</strong> which even allows you to search for enchantments, and also direct <strong>access to your armor</strong> from within the interface.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The infuser comes in two versions: A basic one made from <strong>amethyst</strong>, and an advanced one made from <strong>netherite</strong>. The differences are quite substantial, so it might be a good idea to upgrade your infuser sooner than later: In addition to freshly enchanting items, the advanced infuser can also change enchantment levels, or even completely remove individual enchantments (curses are excluded from this). And that's not all! You can even use your experience levels to repair your tools. Furthermore both infusers differ in how they scale level costs, with the advanced version being quite a bit cheaper obviously.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">By default, the basic version <strong>requires around 30 levels</strong> to max out all enchantments for an item. In contrast to vanilla, you'll have to pay all those levels and not just a maximum of 3. This makes the cost much higher than going from level 27 to 30. The advanced infuser on the other hand is quite a bit less costly, <strong>requiring around 20</strong> levels at max. This is just a bit more than going from level 27 to 30 in the vanilla system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">To work, the infuser <strong>requires bookshelves</strong> around it, just like the vanilla enchanting table. Most <strong>enchantments and higher enchantment levels require a certain amount</strong> to be unlocked. Place those bookshelves around the infuser with a gap of one block in two layers (at the infuser's level, and one block above it).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The enchanting infuser <strong>does not offer treasure enchantments and curses</strong>, this means an enchantment which you can never obtain at a vanilla enchanting table will also not show up here. So you'll still have to use those cheesy librarians for your mending needs!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/411/407/2021-11-29_19.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/411/409/2021-11-29_19.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Both enchanting infuser versions looking extra sharp</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Choose which enchantments you want to put on your gear</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/411/410/2021-11-29_19.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/411/411/2021-11-29_19.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Select the enchantments you want and enchant your item</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Not all enchantments are compatible with each other</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/411/412/2021-11-29_19.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/411/413/2021-11-29_19.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Add more bookshelves to unlock enchantments and higher levels</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Helpful search and Enchantment Descriptions support</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/411/414/2021-11-29_19.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/411/415/2021-11-29_19.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Crafting your first enchanting infuser</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Upgrading your infuser to the next level</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enchanting-infuser-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Uhm, the enchantment costs are way too overpriced / way too cheap!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Don't worry, all parameters for calculating enchantment costs are exposed in the server config file. Simply edit them to your liking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: What's this mysterious enchanting power my enchanting infuser keeps telling me about?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> That's simply the number of bookshelves surrounding the infuser. You can see how many you already have in the bottom-right corner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I can't get the mending enchantment!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> The enchanting infuser offers the same enchantment selection the vanilla enchanting table has. Special enchantments (e.g. mending and curses) can be enabled and configured in the server config though.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Does the enchanting infuser also support disenchanting and repairing?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes, the advanced enchanting infuser can do this for you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I don't get any levels back when disenchanting!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> You don't get levels, but you get experience points, the same amount as when using a grindstone. This is necessary due to how experience levels scale in Minecraft, otherwise you would potentially receive way more experience in levels than you've actually spent enchanting!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I enable the tooltips with enchantment descriptions?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> The descriptions are provided by a separate mod: <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enchantment-descriptions\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Enchantment Descriptions</strong></span></a> by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/darkhaxdev\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Darkhax</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I'm using the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apotheosis\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Apotheosis</strong></span></a> mod by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/shadows_of_fire\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Shadows_of_Fire</strong></span></a> which alters the enchanting system quite significantly. Are those changes compatible with my enchanting infuser?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes, they are! When Apotheosis is installed, enchanting infusers will support higher levels for enchantments. Also costs will be significantly increased to better resemble Apotheosis' own enchanting mechanics. You'll also now have to use Apotheosis' more powerful bookshelves for your infuser to reach its full potential.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I don't like the infuser textures, do you have something that's more inline with vanilla's enchanting table?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Wow, that hurts. Nah, just kidding.

alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a>\n<hr>\n\n## 📖About 📖\n</center>\n\nTired of incomplete wood sets? Well you came to the right place!\n\nThis Mod serves as an addon to many popular mods and is meant to fill in the gaps by adding all the blocks that such mods add in all wood types currently installed.\n\nEvery block type added is available in ALL wood types.\n\nWith this mod you won't need extra compatibility addons and instead only rely on a single universal one! It's all automatic!\n\nAdditionally the mod will try to convert any block from other uninstalled compat mods into its equivalent ones.\n\n<center>\n\n## 🪑 Supported Blocks🪑\n</center>\n\n### Quark\n- Posts\n- Stripped posts\n- Hedges\n- Bookshelves\n- Vertical Planks\n- Ladders\n- Chests\n\n### Farmers Delight\n- Cabinets\n\n### Twilight Forest\n- Hollow Logs\n- Banisters\n\n### Decorative Blocks\n- Seats\n- Palisades\n- Supports\n- Beams\n\n### Architects Palette\n- Boards\n- Railings\n\n### Valhesia Structures\n- Posts\n- Cut Posts\n\n### Another Furniture\n- Tables\n- Chairs\n- Shelves\n- Flower Boxes\n- Shutters\n- Drawers\n- Benches\n\n### Storage Drawers\n- Drawers\n\n### Furnish\n- All wooden blocks\n\n### Builders and Craft Additions\n- All wooden blocks\n\n### Mosaic Carpentry\n- Mosaics\n\n### MrCrayfish Furniture Mod\n- All wooden blocks\n\n### Twigs\n- Tables\n\n### Macaw's Mods\n- Fences\n- Windows\n- Bridges\n- Lights\n- Paths\n- Furnitures\n- Rooves\n\n<center>\n\n## ❓ F. A. Q. ❓\n</center>\n\nQ: How the heck does this work?\n> A: Magic.\n\nQ: Is this compatible with other compat mods?\n> A: Yes, I've included a list of many popular compat mods. The mod will do its best not to register stuff that's already in them when they are installed\n\nQ: I'm a mod author, could I use this mod to add support to my blocks?\n> A: Yes! The mod includes a very simple and easy to use API with which modders can register an entire block definition in only 10 lines! The mod will automatically generate all assets automatically\n\nQ: Can you add support for \"x\" wood type?\n> A: Go try the mod\n\nQ: A block type isnt supported, can I add it myself?\n> A: Not directly as registration cant be conditional and cant depend on config files. If you are a modder and know code you can make a pull request to the mod or use the EveryCompatAPI class directly in your mods (check their javadocs & mod modules for info)\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

here.](https://modrinth.com/mod/snow-under-trees-remastered)\n\n### Functionality\nSnow Under Trees adds, who would have thought, snow under trees. This will happen whenever new chunks are generated, or when it is snowing. Do note, that only biomes in which it is cold enough to snow are affected. Normal forests for instance will be unaffected. Modded biomes will work. Support for Snow! Real Magic!, Serene Seasons, and Dynamic Trees is included.\n\n### Showcase\nHere you can see a comparison between the same vanilla Snowy Taiga biome generated without (before) and with (after) this mod installed:\n![Showcase](https://i.imgur.com/ICumqlk.gif)\n\n### Config\n- *enable_biome_feature* - Setting this to false will disable snow from generating under trees when new chunks are generated.\n- *enable_when_snowing* - Setting this to false will disable snow from generating under trees when it is snowing in the world.\n- *filtered_biomes* - Any biomes whose biome IDs are added here will not be affected by this mod in any way. You can find the biome ID of the biome you're currently in on the F3 screen. For example, the biome ID of the plains biome looks like this: minecraft:plains\n\nYou are allowed to use this mod in any modpack.","published":"2022-11-19T10:34:02.474982Z","updated":"2024-05-06T15:45:35.296697Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":81133,"followers":44,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["85KGx8j1","VoViJ3JX","iY5GJjbW","F7nbTCnz","6HqlheSl","IzNdMwzN","qsdWlJlR","Sdb6K176","FIcm7YRC","CvHmMEti","VnIfWWY7","uQIpiqhS","Wt1kNH3h","65NXuu2L","XFcgp0Wi","dO9o7xWe","Ld6TsvRW","rXiZAPnk","RfMOxne8","ts7OUxFI","jaKOCf56","FYjQv8zP","2d4qEJZG"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Q3vyMuj2/e734be6e876c1479eecdf7530fbe6db90a167fd4.png"},"version":{"id":"jaKOCf56","project_id":"Q3vyMuj2","author_id":"j2vvv1qU","featured":true,"name":"1.20.1-v1.4.4","version_number":"v1.4.4","changelog":"- Fix snow still showing up under trees during snowfall when Serene Season's \"generate_snow_ice\" config setting is set to false","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-14T18:05:22.845609Z","downloads":4280,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"aac8f5be38a9a1ebfb2fc8e048add61070ab4862eb075062b3c0d36f291377f74eaa2e1155f83b7f95d5ffb5bead44ea1099914c3ac3246cca04c5ebc0d1a83b","sha1":"06bbd6b227184ee8f359d57ebe86dcc4d0fac50e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Q3vyMuj2/versions/jaKOCf56/snowundertrees-1.20.1-1.4.4.jar","filename":"snowundertrees-1.20.1-1.4.4.jar","primary":true,"size":27254,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gsj8K6OY","user":{"id":"j2vvv1qU","username":"bl4ckscor3","name":"bl4ckscor3","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/j2vvv1qU/a33ac86ccb684d2fb402233151412018699f1c3c.png","bio":"","created":"2021-06-27T09:17:06.110534Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"snowundertrees-1.20.1-1.4.4.jar"},"mods\\justhammers-forge-2.0.3+mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"3d20301a35f96a6369e5f75ec05226cb18d3a48c64a377790d718ca24fffb20c290efbade5328cb3ebfe8a1c760c84331df6f3059a665ed1b02020bc7852c292","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"edU0NbZZ","slug":"just-hammers","project_type":"mod","team":"ko5qkqeI","title":"Just Hammers","description":"Adds hammers to the game that are able to mine in a 3x3, 3x3x3, 5x5x1, 5x5x3 and finally a 5x5x5!

Amazing as always!\n\n## TODO\n\n- [x] Add tool tips to tell people what each hammer does\n- [ ] Add support for rendering larger block outline whilst holding hammer\n- [ ] Add breaking animation to

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2024-05-01T06:08:18.836384Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":4633749,"followers":4997,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9","agJm6Vrw","PPnbi6JY","HWBrlwWv","i9RcCdZv"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"DG5Fn9Sz","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1

Its main focus lies in reducing the lag caused by redstone dust, by optimizing the power calculations and reducing the number of shape and block updates emitted. As a side effect of these changes the block update order of redstone dust networks is predictable and intuitive rather than locational and chaotic.\n\n### Performance\n\nMSPT contributions of redstone dust are up to 20 times lower with Alternate Current, all the while maintaining a high level of Vanilla parity. Its low number of code modifications make it minimally invasive, so it's an easy drop-in replacement for Vanilla redstone dust.\n\nCheck out the [GitHub page](https://github.com/SpaceWalkerRS/alternate-current/blob/main/README.md) for a detailed explanation of Alternate Current's improvements.\n\n## Why is redstone dust so laggy?\n\nThere are two main reasons why redstone dust is laggy: unnecessary updates and unnecessary calculations, both of which are caused by the fact that redstone dust updates recursively. A redstone wire can update its power level over half a dozen times before settling on the final value, doing expensive calculations and emitting copious amounts of shape and block updates each time. On top of that, many shape and block updates are completely redundant. \n\n## How does Alternate Current fix that?\n\nAlternate Current fixes these issues by doing power calculations of the entire network before updating the power levels. Each wire will check power from non-wire components just once and power from other wires just twice. Power sources within the network are identified, and the power is spread from there.

The basic one is 1 block sized. The others are 1x2, 2x1 and 2x2 block sized.</li>\n<li>Using a canvas (by itself) with right-click lets you view its content.</li>\n<li>Using a palette (by itself) lets you open the palette interface, where you can mix colors to create custom ones.</li>\n<li>Using a canvas in one hand and a palette on the other lets you open both interfaces at once, where you can paint on the canvas using the colors on your palette. You can mix colors here as well.</li>\n<li>Another option is to place the canvas on an easel and right click the easel with a palette at hand.</li>\n<li>The color mixing rules work the same way as the vanilla leather armor dyeing mechanic.</li>\n<li>Change the brush size or opacity with the mouse wheel or by clicking on the GUI element</li>\n<li>Undo mistakes with the CTRL+Z shortcut</li>\n<li>After painting a canvas, you can use it on a wall similar to vanilla paintings to hang it on the wall.</li>\n<li>Hitting the hanged canvas or breaking a block it rests on will drop it back as an item.</li>\n<li>Sign a painting to give it a name and make it unchangeable.</li>\n<li>Copy signed paintings by crafting them together with an empty canvas of the same shape.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crafting Recipes</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Vpf9MsM/canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting a canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"159\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/7rwQHrr/long-canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting long canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"142\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/dByhxvw/tall-canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting tall canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"145\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/26jnbYv/large-canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting a large canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"134\" /></p>\n<p>To craft a palette, you need at least one kind of dye:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/7Xy8959/palette-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting a palette\" width=\"400\" height=\"134\" /></p>\n<p>You can fill an existing palette with other dyes later:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/L8V5BsS/palette-fill.png\" alt=\"Filling a palette\" width=\"400\" height=\"132\" /></p>\n<p>You can copy signed paintings:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/PW9LKrG/copying-recipe.png\" alt=\"Copying a signed painting\" width=\"400\" height=\"132\" /></p>\n<h5>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Crafting an easel:</span></h5>\n<h5><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/jWg0Xkx/java-zva-Bwzjr8-A.png\" alt=\"Easel recipe\" width=\"400\" height=\"178\" /></h5>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Community</h4>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://discord.gg/kAXdzKGXtW\">Discord server</a> now, where you can share your creations with the world!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>About shaders:</h4>\n<p>The latest versions (1.18.2, 1.19.2 and above) seem to work fine with custom shaders, but there is no guarantee that it will work with every shader.

Designed for better user experience and API.\n\nJade can be installed only on the client side. But many features require Jade on the server side. (item storage, horse stats, bees in beehive...)\n\n**For mod integration, try Jade Addons: [Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade-addons-forge)  [Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade-addons-fabric)**\n\n### Keys (default):\n\n - Keypad 0: Open configuration screen\n - Keypad 1: Toggle overlay\n - Keypad 2: Toggle liquid display\n - Keypad 3: Show recipes (Requires JEI)\n - Keypad 4: Show uses (Requires JEI)\n - Keypad 5: Narrate target\n\n### Notable changes compared to Hwyla:\n\n - API re-design\n - More vanilla addons\n - Higher configurability\n - Better

It should generate `kubejs` folder in your minecraft directory with example scripts. startup scripts only get run once when the game loads. Those are for registering items, setting up configs etc. Server/data scripts are loaded when you join a world, those are better for things like clearlag, displaying custom login messages and world/player related things in general.\n\n## Can I reload scripts?\nYes, use `/reload`. Note: Not everything is reloadable. Some things require you to restart game, some only world, some work on fly.\n\n## I don't know JavaScript / I need help with this mod\nThere's examples and pre-made scripts on [KubeJS Wiki](https://kubejs.com/).\n\n## How does this mod work?\nIt uses [Rhino](https://modrinth.com/mod/rhino), a JavaScript engine originally by Mozilla.\n\n## Ok, but what if it.. doesn't work?\nYou can report issues on [Here](https://kubejs.com/support?source=kubejs).\n\n## I have more questions/suggestions!\nIf wiki didn't have the answer for what you were looking for, you can join the [Discord

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## 🖥️ Need a server?

Expansion","description":"Adds parrying, enchantments, tiers and customization to shields for more fun!","body":"![](https://i.imgur.com/XbGM1qk.png)\n# Shield Expansion\nShield Expansion is a mod that aims to make combat in Minecraft more engaging and skilful by rebalancing shields.\nThe mod adds traditional tiers to shields and introduces two new mechanics, Off-Guard Cooldown and Parrying!\n\n\n### Parrying\nParrying an attack, done by raising your shield just before an attack hits you, allows you to bypass Off-Guard Cooldown, rewarding skilful timing and use of your shield. You shove melee attackers back and deflect enemy projectiles upon a successful Parry, too!\n\nPushing an enemy with a wooden or golden shield will deal no damage, but doing so with any other will result in a Parry-Bash, dealing the enemy back a percentage of the damage they would have dealt you! This percentage increases the higher the shield tier is, but the opportunity window to parry at all shrinks.\n\n### Compatibility\nShield Expansion has native compatibility with our other mod, Mining Master! With it, you can upgrade your Diamond Shield into the elusive and powerful Paragon Shield!\n\nOr, if complete blast resistance is more your style, perhaps you may prefer the build-in combability we added for Team Abnormals' Savage and Ravage!\n\nBesides that, we went to the effort of programming the mod in such a way so that SE's attributes apply to all shields from all other mods! Said attributes can be tweaked to your liking with a handy-dandy datapack, whilst basic functionality for all shields can be tweaked in the config!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ne6GqCP.png)\n\nI'd also highly suggest pairing this mod with Combat Roll!\nLooking for something similar to this mod on Fabric? Check out Cammie's Combat Tweaks, or Guarding!\n\nWant a resource pack to bring your tools and armour up to snuff alongside your fancy new shields?\nNeko's Enhanced Tools and Armor pairs great with Shield Expansion!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1hnNiHa.png)","published":"2022-02-27T00:23:55.983651Z","updated":"2024-01-13T03:01:37.660806Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":62761,"followers":95,"categories":["adventure","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["NUzBqV0j","OGI7qkWx","BtqJEnO6","yIXAwLMI","4h6oW0vc","40HP4NPu","rGxCClGm","MbDsxSud","JG1wdfKX","vSwjX2A7","J6oBzcem","cbRsYY5f","bXXGFyGw","XrY3bX6F","nIpLWrvR","8mpKmudC"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/sjxWxSao/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"8mpKmudC","project_id":"sjxWxSao","author_id":"xyZWolXT","featured":false,"name":"Shield Expansion 1.1.7a","version_number":"1.1.7a","changelog":"Fixed advancement \"Not Today, Thank You\" not unlocking","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-13T03:01:38.263880Z","downloads":12303,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"70534f52698508a4995f7d3aa62d75a231c01d46","sha512":"da142cff9da330d07ee7667a07a2635d4168eea45c1918577bb0e19ed499b89bbb4031925051d298b6100d60c0f8cc0b8b4cfad0b838b22102f9391134cf067b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/sjxWxSao/versions/8mpKmudC/ShieldExpansion-1.20.1-1.1.7a.jar","filename":"ShieldExpansion-1.20.1-1.1.7a.jar","primary":true,"size":286625,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"HKbnoXae","user":{"id":"sECNANPe","username":"SwanX1","name":"SwanX1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36593309?v=4","bio":"I just code node apps...That's basically it • 16 • they/them","created":"2021-01-28T07:11:08.829257Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"HKbnoXae","user":{"id":"xyZWolXT","username":"tinytransfem","name":"Ciri","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74989701?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-01-21T23:03:14.496064Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"HKbnoXae","user":{"id":"2rfa7IRZ","username":"LudoCrypt","name":"LudoCrypt","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/60561627?v=4","bio":"Expert in all things liminal","created":"2020-12-19T20:19:17.303449Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Alpha Developer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"HKbnoXae","user":{"id":"Crn59xeZ","username":"InfernalStudios","name":"Neko","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47757977?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-02-04T19:59:27.623711Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ShieldExpansion-1.20.1-1.1.7a.jar"},"mods\\dungeons-and-taverns-ancient-city-overhaul-1.jar":{"sha512":"750ac05375ecf0d00feeffc5ac25c77d0829cbc825ff07ccb686fdb22ba8a4d30842a99da9069dd0a8877ce4fd0cd42d541cb9a5bc034cc2d6737385882c5505","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"DNuNq5bb","slug":"dungeons-and-taverns-ancient-city-overhaul","project_type":"mod","team":"UxVdDPs4","title":"Dungeons and Taverns Ancient City Overhaul","description":"Standalone Splinter version of Dungeons and Taverns Ancient City Overhaul","body":"This Standalone Splinter Version of Dungeons and Taverns adds the Ancient City Overhaul by\n- making the main walls slimmer and taller\n- adding slim roads\n- removing the Deepslate Cobblestone ring structures\n- adding rumble to all Structure parts with archelogy loot tables\n- adding several smaller houses \n- adding smaller versions of the current city parts\n- adding a 2nd ice box structure\n- adding 2 amethyst box structures\n- adding small road lanterns\n- adding alarm towers\n- adding 3 chests in the city center statue\n- overhauling the loot table with\n   -

It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel.

Well, that's not a coincidence anymore! Each elder guardian will drop a <strong>Trident Fragment</strong>; combine those with a few prismarine shards, and there's your brand new trident!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">But what do you do when your trident is about to run out of durability? Simple: <strong>Repair It With Some Prismarine Shards</strong> using an anvil! Why do you even ask, that's obvious, isn't it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Let's talk about the loyalty enchantment: So your trident comes back to you, nice. But where does it go? Somewhere in your inventory to dig up again? And when you throw it into the void in the End, it's just gone. And what about all the fancy loot from the mobs you've slain, you need to go over there to collect it. Really? Well, all fixed: Tridents always return to the slot they are thrown from (even without loyalty), when thrown into the void they return, and any loot dropped by mobs will come flying at you together with the trident itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Besides that, <strong>Impaling Works As It Does On Bedrock Edition</strong>: any mob in contact with water or rain will receive increased damage. This is especially great, since tridents now finally work against those annoying drowneds infesting your beautiful oceans.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lHSmULI.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/491/965/2022-08-31_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/491/966/2022-08-31_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tridents with loyalty collect all drops for you</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Your trident is damaged?

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

Loader","description":"An open source resource and data loader for Minecraft.","body":"<p>Open Loader is a utility mod that allows data packs and resource packs to be applied globally across all save files in a game instance. This can be used by mod packs and servers to define custom recipes and other features for a wide range of mods. It can also be used to change textures, override tooltips, and change other aspects of the game.</p>\n\n<h3>Data Packs</h3>\n<p>Data packs are used by Minecraft to load recipes, loot tables, functions, and other game mechanics. Many mods also pull from data packs to handle custom recipe systems and other new mechanics. OpenLoader will load any data packs that are placed in the ~/config/openloader/data folder. Before 1.17 they were loaded from ~/openloader/data instead. OpenLoader can load zipped and folder packs. You can learn more about data packs <a href=\"https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_pack\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Resource Packs</h3>\n<p>Resource packs are used to define textures, translations, sounds, and other client data. You can use them to override existing resources or add completely new ones. These packs are loaded from the ~/config/openloader/resources folder. Before 1.17 they were loaded from ~/openloader/resources instead. OpenLoader can load zipped or unzipped packs.&nbsp;You can learn more about resource packs <a href=\"https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Resource_pack\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>FaQ</h3>\n<p><strong>Does this support mods like Patchouli or BotanyPots?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, packs loaded by this mod will behave exactly like packs loaded through the vanilla systems. So anything that works through the normal resource packs folder or the world datapack folder will work here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My pack is not loading?</strong></p>\n<p>If your pack is not loading it is because you have not followed the instructions properly or have made an invalid pack. Make sure you have the file placed in the right folder and that your pack has a valid pack.mcmeta file. Unfortunately I do not have the time or resources to help you debug your packs, but there are countless resources and communities available to help you make these things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does pack load order work?</strong></p>\n<p>Any resource packs loaded by OpenLoader should be loaded after vanilla and modded resource packs. Data pack load orders are done on a per-world basis instead and can be very annoying. Initially all data packs loaded by this mod will be loaded after vanilla and modded packs. Any mods added to the game after that initial world load will load after all previously loaded packs but only for that world. This can be fixed by using Vanilla's data pack command to correct the world order on a per-world basis. If you need more consistent control over load order I would recommend a scripting tool like <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafttweaker\" rel=\"nofollow\">CraftTweaker</a> which is more robust and stable than the data pack system.</p>\n\n<h3>Files</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-loader/versions?l=forge\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-loader/versions?l=fabric\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fabric</a><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dark-paintings/files/all?filter-status=1&filter-game-version=2020709689:7499\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Pledge on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Darkhax\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patreon</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

This display is also now used in the inventory, as it's way more compact and allows for many more effects to be shown before they start to overlap. And this new inventory display is no longer limited to the player inventory, now you can see your active effects in every container!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">But wait, now that status effects are shown small and compact with just an icon, how will you find out how your active effects are called? Don't worry, a handy tooltip is added for that. The tooltip will be even more useful when <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-enough-effect-descriptions-jeed\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Just Enough Effect Descriptions</strong></span></a> by <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/mehvahdjukaar\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>MehVahdJukaar</strong></span></a> is installed.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">You like the vanilla inventory status effect display and want to keep it or even use it on the hud as well?

You'll find everything from shattered islands, to floating valleys, to crystallized peaks! Different regions of the End - on very large scales - have different properties and feelings to allow for almost infinite variation in terrain shapes. From sponge-like porous terrain, to stretched alien landscapes, to stacked rounded islands; you'll find new and interesting terrain no matter how far you go.\n__ __\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n","published":"2022-11-23T00:37:43.847598Z","updated":"2023-12-07T22:26:32.265057Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":336688,"followers":589,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["qgcEh2CX","krUi6WMq","qFzFO6Ir","oN3IWKBO","Z04FxO0c","2Oo6cuEV","aDm1dD3Q","uXfroGYN","M1tAEtbt","tM4b5n8e","O0uQyKki","w4mEZnbU","zO4Fl1np"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LPjGiSO4/b6a7489ca6a0fd553870f9d1c24224d0555232d3.png"},"version":{"id":"zO4Fl1np","project_id":"LPjGiSO4","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v1.2.4 ~ 1.20.4","version_number":"1.2.4","changelog":"# Nullscape 1.2.4\n- Officially supports 1.20.3/4\n- Added empty function file for manual compat with other datapacks","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-07T22:26:34.711229Z","downloads":162104,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"c6012c383432e8ccdac42ed76c13461802e2687657b0a037daa56b81f2e1542ea976451caaffa421f88efb3e3a53d955845f7f0ae54e8826fcaedac9b08005d6","sha1":"c70810239c6613868c61381dcc4415a9f09c04df"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LPjGiSO4/versions/zO4Fl1np/Nullscape_1.20.4_v1.2.4.jar","filename":"Nullscape_1.20.4_v1.2.4.jar","primary":true,"size":319521,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Nullscape_1.20.4_v1.2.4.jar"},"mods\\entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"14f6b9b3161d6ebeaefaa1efc08b72a98d82aacf6f9956c3a5bff9daaae3d0200cfdb2034c2321849acf0aafaf0450cbd075a92138e1500f31a70666c59e258f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"NNAgCjsB","slug":"entityculling","project_type":"mod","team":"hLPrl6Gq","title":"Entity Culling","description":"Using async path-tracing to hide Block-/Entities that are not visible","body":"# EntityCulling\n\nUsing async path-tracing to skip rendering Block/Entities that are not visible. [Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png?v=2)](https://shockbyte.com/partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default.

All axes perform more chops with \"expanded\" upgrades.\n- (1.18.2+) Silent Gear: saws perform extra chops\n- (1.18.2+) [Project MMO](https://modrinth.com/mod/project-mmo): chopping grants woodcutting XP\n- (1.18.2+) [Jade](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade), [WTHIT](https://modrinth.com/mod/wthit), [TheOneProbe](https://modrinth.com/mod/the-one-probe): show number of log blocks in trees and the number of chops needed to fell.\n\n#### Known issues:\n- (1.18.2 and earlier) Multi Mine: choppable blocks need to be added to Multi Mine's blacklist. This should be fixed for 1.19+ versions. See [#106](https://github.com/hammertater/treechop/issues/106).\n- Some modded trees leave floating blocks when felled. See [#44](https://github.com/hammertater/treechop/issues/44).\n\n_Want to make your mod compatible with TreeChop?

How do I turn off chopping?\nPress n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle off the \"chopping\" setting. A key can also be bound to toggle chopping without opening the settings screen; go to Options > Controls and find the section labeled \"HT's TreeChop\".\n\n#### 2. How do I keep chopping off and only turn it on while sneaking?\nBy default, sneaking inverts your current chop setting, so just toggle chopping off (press n to access the settings screen) so that chopping will be enabled by sneaking.\n\n#### 3. How do I keep chopping even when sneaking?\nPress n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle off the \"Sneaking inverts chopping\" setting.\n\n#### 4. How do I keep from chopping my house down?\nThere's a setting to disable chopping if the \"tree\" is not connected to leaves. Press n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle \"trees must have leaves\".\n\n#### 5. I started chopping my house down. How do I stop?\nIf you find yourself chopping a block when you just wanted to break it normally, try breaking the block while sneaking, or toggle off chopping (press n to access the settings screen).\n\n#### 6. I was chopping something and the game crashed! What's up with that?\nProbably the item you used to chop the tree doesn't play nice with TreeChop. Go to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and add the item's registry name to choppingToolsBlacklist, or ask the server owner to, and then maybe let me know about the conflict and I'll try to fix it.\n\n#### 7. Why can't I chop anymore?\nMaybe chopping is turned off; press n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle on the \"chopping\" setting. If chopping is enabled and changing tools doesn't help, then there might be a conflict with another mod. If you send me a recent log, I'll try to fix it.\n\n#### 8. Why do some trees leave behind floating leaves when felled?\nEither\na) it's a modded tree and its leaves are not set up properly. Let me know what type of tree is misbehaving, and I'll politely inform the mod owners.\nb) there are too many leaves! You can increase the max number of leaves by going to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and increasing maxLeavesBlocks.\n\n#### 9. Why do some trees leave behind floating logs when felled?\nEither\na) it's a modded tree and is weirdly shaped. Let me know, and I'll try to make TreeChop do a better job of detecting that type of tree.\nb) the tree is too big! You can increase the max tree size by going to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and increasing maxTreeBlocks.\n\n#### 10. How do I disable mushroom and fungus chopping?\nGo to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and change\n    blockTagForDetectingLogs = \"treechop:choppables\"\nto\n    blockTagForDetectingLogs = \"treechop:choppables_except_mushrooms\"\nIf you want more control over which blocks can be chopped, you have to make your own datapack and fiddle with the block tags (see https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tag for more info).\n\n#### 12. Why am I not seeing the [fill in the blank] feature?\nOnly the newest version of Minecraft 1.16 is fully supported. Some older versions, especially 1.12.2, lack some of the fancier features.\n\n#### 11. Can I include this in a modpack?\nYes!\n\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Sample configs:</summary>\n\n<details><summary>treechop-common.toml</summary>\n\n```toml\n[permissions]\n\n\t[permissions.choppingEnabled]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n\t[permissions.fellingEnabled]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n\t[permissions.sneakBehavior]\n\t\tcanBeNone = true\n\t\tcanBeInvertFelling = true\n\t\tcanBeInvertChopping = true\n\n\t[permissions.treeMustHaveLeaves]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n\t[permissions.chopInCreativeMode]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n[general]\n\t#If false, log items will be destroyed when chopping\n\tdropLootForChoppedBlocks = true\n\n[treeDetection]\n\t#Maximum number of log blocks that can be detected to belong to one tree\n\t#Range: 1 ~ 8096\n\tmaxTreeBlocks = 320\n\t#Maximum number of leaves blocks that can destroyed when a tree is felled\n\t#Range: 1 ~ 8096\n\tmaxLeavesBlocks = 1024\n\t#Destroy leaves when a tree is felled\n\tbreakLeaves = true\n\t#Non-decayable leaves are ignored when detecting leaves\n\tignorePersistentLeaves = true\n\t#Maximum distance from log blocks to destroy non-standard leaves blocks (e.g. mushroom caps) when felling\n\t#Range: 0 ~ 16\n\tmaxBreakLeavesDistance = 7\n\n\t[treeDetection.logs]\n\t\t#Blocks that should be considered choppable\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\tblocks = [\"#treechop:choppables\", \"#minecraft:logs\", \"#forge:mushroom_stems\"]\n\t\t#Blocks that should never be chopped, even if included in the list above\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\texceptions = [\"minecraft:bamboo\"]\n\n\t[treeDetection.leaves]\n\t\t#Blocks that should be considered leaves\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\tblocks = [\"#treechop:leaves_like\", \"#minecraft:leaves\", \"#minecraft:wart_blocks\", \"#forge:mushroom_caps\", \"minecraft:shroomlight\"]\n\t\t#Blocks that should never be considered leaves, even if included in the list above\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\texceptions = []\n\n[chopCounting]\n\t#Method to use for computing the number of chops needed to fell a tree\n\t#Allowed Values: LINEAR, LOGARITHMIC\n\talgorithm = \"LOGARITHMIC\"\n\t#How to round the number of chops needed to fell a tree;
